# 514 auth

Use `514 auth` to establish the trust boundary for the CLI agent harness.

Once authenticated, every other command (`setup`, `link`, and follow-on workflow commands) can act on your cloud OLAP workloads with the correct account and project permissions.

## Subcommands

### Login

Start browser-based sign in.

```bash
514 auth login
```

Expected outcome:
- Browser sign-in flow opens.
- CLI receives a valid session.

Recovery:
- If browser launch fails, open: `https://www.fiveonefour.boreal.cloud/login`
- Retry command: `514 auth login`

### Whoami

Show the currently authenticated account.

```bash
514 auth whoami
```

Expected outcome:
- Prints account identity and confirms active session.

Recovery:
- If unauthenticated, run: `514 auth login`

### Logout

Clear local auth session for the current machine.

```bash
514 auth logout
```

Expected outcome:
- Local session is removed.

Recovery:
- To authenticate again, run: `514 auth login`

## Typical Flow

```bash
514 auth login
514 auth whoami
```
