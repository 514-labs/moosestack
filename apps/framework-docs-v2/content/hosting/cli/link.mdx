# 514 link

Use `514 link` when your repository already exists locally and you need to associate it with a Fiveonefour project.

In the agent harness model, `link` maps your local repo to the correct hosted workload target without forcing a fresh clone.

## Syntax

```bash
514 link [options]
```

## Common Options

- `--project <org>/<project>`: Explicit project slug override.
- `--yes`: Auto-confirm safe prompts.
- `--no-input`: Disable prompts; fail fast on missing required input.
- `--force-relink`: Replace an existing repo-level link.

## Example

```bash
514 link --project acme/analytics-api
```

Expected outcome:
- Validates auth and local git repo context.
- Resolves project and creates repo-level link metadata.
- Keeps git remotes unchanged by default.
