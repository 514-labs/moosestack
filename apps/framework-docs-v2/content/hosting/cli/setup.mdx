# 514 setup

Use `514 setup <org>/<project>` to bootstrap a local workspace from an existing Fiveonefour project.

This command is the main provisioning step in the CLI agent harness: it verifies cloud access, prepares local git state, and creates a runnable workspace that stays aligned with the hosted project lifecycle.

## Syntax

```bash
514 setup <org>/<project> [options]
```

## Options

- `--path <dir>`: Parent directory for clone destination.
- `--dir-name <name>`: Local directory name override.
- `--branch <name>`: Branch name to create.
- `--no-branch`: Skip branch creation.
- `--push`: Push created branch.
- `--no-push`: Do not push branch.
- `--run <install|dev|both|skip>`: Choose local follow-up action.
- `--yes`: Auto-confirm safe prompts.
- `--no-input`: Disable prompts and fail fast if required input is missing.

## Interactive Example

```bash
514 setup acme/analytics-api
```

Expected flow:
- Checks auth, git, project access, and remote readiness.
- Prompts for destination path and folder name.
- Shows planned git commands before mutating actions.
- Optionally creates and pushes branch.
- Optionally runs local setup actions so you can execute workloads immediately.

## Non-Interactive Example

```bash
514 setup acme/analytics-api \
  --path /Users/your-username/dev \
  --dir-name analytics-api \
  --branch feature/add-orders-rollup \
  --push \
  --run both \
  --yes \
  --no-input
```

## Output Model

- Check-only output: preflight validations with no mutation.
- Planned commands: explicit command preview before running.
- Mutating commands: clone, branch creation, and push actions.
- Post-action verification: final paths, branch, and cloud preview route checks.
