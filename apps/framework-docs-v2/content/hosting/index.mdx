# Hosting

514 Hosting is a branch-native control plane for cloud OLAP workloads.

The `514` CLI acts as your agent harness: authenticate, link your repository, and run local workflows that stay in sync with hosted infrastructure.

Every pushed branch automatically gets its own preview environment, and subsequent pushes update that same preview. This gives you isolated validation per branch and a clear path from iteration to merge.

## Preview environments and branches

Hosting deployments are branch-aware:

- Pushing a branch triggers an automatic deployment for that branch.
- Each active branch maps to its own preview environment so you can validate changes in isolation.
- New pushes to the same branch update the same preview environment.
- Merge your branch when the preview is healthy and ready to promote.

## Installation

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) 514
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
514 --version
```

## Start Here

- [`514 auth`](/hosting/cli/auth) - Establish the CLI control plane session for agent runs.
- [`514 setup`](/hosting/cli/setup) - Bootstrap a local workspace from an existing cloud OLAP project.
- [`514 link`](/hosting/cli/link) - Attach an existing repository to a hosted project so agents can target the right workload.

## Workflow

- [Cloud to local setup](/hosting/workflow/cloud-to-local-setup) - End-to-end flow from cloud project access to local execution.

## Integrations

- [Vercel _(coming soon)_](/hosting/integrations/vercel) - Native Vercel-connected workflows and deployment interoperability.

## Troubleshooting

- [Setup failures](/hosting/troubleshooting/setup-failures) - Recovery commands and routes for common blockers.
