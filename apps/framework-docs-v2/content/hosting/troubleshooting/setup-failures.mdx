# Setup failures

Each section includes:
- Symptom
- Likely cause
- Next command(s)
- Recovery route

Use this page when the CLI harness cannot complete a handoff between local repo state and cloud project state.

## 1. Auth expired or missing

Symptom:
- Setup or link commands fail with auth-required message.

Likely cause:
- No active CLI session.

Next command(s):

```bash
514 auth login
```

Recovery route:
- [Fiveonefour login](https://www.fiveonefour.boreal.cloud/login)

## 2. Repo access denied or slug invalid

Symptom:
- Project cannot be resolved or accessed.

Likely cause:
- Incorrect `<org>/<project>` or missing permissions.

Next command(s):

```bash
514 setup <org>/<project>
```

Recovery routes:
- [Fiveonefour projects](https://www.fiveonefour.boreal.cloud/projects)
- [GitHub app installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)

## 3. Destination path conflict

Symptom:
- Clone destination exists and is not empty.

Likely cause:
- Local folder already contains files.

Next command(s):

```bash
514 setup <org>/<project> --path <new-parent> --dir-name <new-folder>
```

Recovery route:
- Local filesystem path currently in conflict.

## 4. Invalid branch name

Symptom:
- Branch creation rejected.

Likely cause:
- Branch name does not satisfy git branch format.

Next command(s):

```bash
git check-ref-format --branch feature/add-orders
```

Recovery route:
- Local repository path where branch will be created.

## 5. Push failure

Symptom:
- Branch push fails after local branch is created.

Likely cause:
- Git auth issue or branch protection rules.

Next command(s):

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Recovery routes:
- Repository branch rules in GitHub
- Boreal project page for deployment status
