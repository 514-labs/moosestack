# Trigger deployment

Use this workflow after your repository is linked and your branch contains changes ready for a cloud deployment.

A new deployment is automatically triggered when you push a branch. You do not need to run an explicit deploy command in `514` CLI.

Branch to preview mapping:
- Each pushed branch gets a preview environment.
- Additional pushes to that branch update the same preview environment.
- Different branches create different previews, which makes branch-level validation explicit.

## 1. Confirm local repo state

From repository root:

```bash
git status
```

Make sure the target branch is checked out and includes the commits you want deployed.

## 2. Push the branch

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

If your branch already tracks origin, use:

```bash
git push
```

## 3. Verify deployment status

- Confirm `git push` completed successfully.
- Open your Fiveonefour project page and confirm build progress.
- Validate the preview URL for the same branch before merging.

## 4. Troubleshoot failed deploys

- Re-run after resolving local build or auth issues.
- Confirm project linkage and permissions.
- Re-check branch protection and required checks in GitHub.
