# Fiveonefour hosting to local setup

This workflow covers the adjacent steps around CLI commands that are required to complete local setup successfully.

## 1. Confirm Fiveonefour hosting access

- Sign in: `https://www.boreal.cloud/sign-in`
- Confirm target project exists and you have access.

## 2. Confirm GitHub integration access

- Open GitHub app installations: `https://github.com/settings/installations`
- Verify the relevant org/repo is authorized for Fiveonefour.

## 3. Choose destination path intentionally

- Prefer an explicit parent directory for predictable clones.
- Avoid non-empty destination directories unless intentionally reusing them.

## 4. Use branch names that pass validation

Recommended format:

```txt
feature/<kebab-summary>
```

Examples:
- `feature/add-orders-rollup`
- `feature/fix-ingest-timeout`

## 5. Push and verify preview routing

- If setup created a branch, push it when prompted.
- Verify preview/deployment status in Fiveonefour hosting project UI.

## 6. Verify local state

Run from repository root:

```bash
git status
```

Then continue with your local development loop.
