# Engine and Dev Profile

This page defines the configuration contract for multi-engine and remote-first development.

## Status

| Contract Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| ClickHouse-centric config (`clickhouse_config`) | Current |
| `--no-infra` local runtime mode | Current |
| Engine-neutral config (`[olap]`) | Planned (RFC) |
| Dev profile config (`[dev_infra]`) | Planned (RFC) |

## Current Configuration Surface

Today, Moose projects are configured primarily with engine-specific sections:

```toml
[clickhouse_config]
db_name = "local"
host = "localhost"
host_port = 18123
user = "panda"
password = "pandapass"

[redpanda_config]
broker = "localhost:19092"
namespace = "myapp"

# Optional: skip local infra loading for this instance
load_infra = false
```

## Planned Configuration Contract (RFC)

```toml
# planned contract
[olap]
engine = "clickhouse" # clickhouse | duckdb | snowflake
profile = "local"     # local | remote
connection = "..."

[dev_infra]
profile = "local"     # local | remote_hybrid | remote_full
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility">
The planned model is additive. Existing `clickhouse_config` projects remain valid during transition.
</Callout>

## Backward-Compatible Mapping

| Existing Surface | Planned Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `[clickhouse_config]` | `[olap]` with `engine = "clickhouse"` |
| `moose dev --no-infra` | `dev profile = remote_hybrid` intent |
| `--clickhouse-url` flags | engine-neutral URL/engine flags (planned aliases) |

## Diagnostics Contract

Planned diagnostics categories:
