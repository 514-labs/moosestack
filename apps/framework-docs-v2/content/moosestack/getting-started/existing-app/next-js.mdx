# Embed ClickHouse analytics in your Next.js app

<Callout type="info" title="Coming Soon">
The Next.js integration guide is currently under development. In the meantime, check out our **[Fastify integration guide](/moosestack/getting-started/existing-app/fastify)** which demonstrates similar patterns for integrating MooseStack with a TypeScript web framework.

## Why Embed ClickHouse in Next.js?

If you need to track user events, run analytics queries, or build dashboards without deploying a separate analytics service, MooseStack lets you embed ClickHouse directly in your Next.js app with type-safe TypeScript models and queries. You keep Next.js as your only runtime while getting production-ready OLAP database capabilities.

## What's Coming

This guide will show you how to:

- Add MooseStack to an existing Next.js (App Router) app as a library
- Model ClickHouse schema in TypeScript in a `moose/` directory
- Query ClickHouse from your Next.js server-side code using type-safe query helpers
- Run migrations against production ClickHouse with the Moose CLI

## Similar Patterns

The **[Fastify integration guide](/moosestack/getting-started/existing-app/fastify)** demonstrates the same patterns for integrating MooseStack with a TypeScript web framework. 

You can use the same `moose/` directory structure and TypeScript configuration as shown in the [example](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack/tree/main/examples/fastify-typescript-starter/moose) for your Next.js app. The only difference is on integration point: you will call queries from your Next.js server-side code instead of your Fastify routes.

Full example coming soon.
