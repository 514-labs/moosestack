# Embed ClickHouse analytics in your Next.js app

<Callout type="info" title="Coming Soon">
The Next.js integration guide is currently under development. In the meantime, check out our **[Fastify integration guide](/moosestack/getting-started/existing-app/fastify)** which demonstrates similar patterns for integrating MooseStack with a TypeScript web framework.
</Callout>

## What's Coming

This guide will show you how to:

- Add MooseStack to an existing Next.js (App Router) app as a library
- Model ClickHouse schema in TypeScript in a `moose/` directory
- Query ClickHouse from your Next.js server-side code using type-safe query helpers
- Run migrations against production ClickHouse with the Moose CLI

## Similar Patterns

The **[Fastify integration guide](/moosestack/getting-started/existing-app/fastify)** covers many of the same concepts:

- Setting up MooseStack in an existing TypeScript project
- Creating Moose models and queries
- Connecting to ClickHouse
- Using MooseStack in your application routes

While the framework-specific details differ, the core MooseStack patterns are the same across frameworks.
