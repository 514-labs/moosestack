## 🐻 Boreal

### New Features
**Live logs view with automatic fallback** ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
  Added a new live logs view that shows the last 15 minutes of logs with real-time updates every second. The logs system now automatically falls back from new structured logs to legacy parsed logs when needed, ensuring compatibility during the transition period.

**Add Vercel integration for automatic environment variable sync** ([@DatGuyJonathan](https://github.com/DatGuyJonathan))
  Adds the foundation for Vercel integration in Boreal, enabling automatic syncing of environment variables (like MOOSE_API_URL) to linked Vercel projects when deployments are created. This integration will help users connect their frontend applications deployed on Vercel with their Moose data infrastructure without manual configuration.

**Track Moose CLI versions in deployments** ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
  Deployments now track and display the version of Moose CLI used to build them, providing better visibility into deployment compatibility and version history. This helps users understand which Moose features are available in their deployed applications and troubleshoot version-related issues.

**Streamlined project creation with one-click deployment** ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))
  The project creation flow has been completely redesigned with a new multi-step wizard that simplifies deploying MooseStack applications. Users can now create projects through an intuitive guided process that includes repository selection, data services configuration, and deployment settings. The new flow supports both GitHub repository imports and template-based deployments, making it easier to get started with new projects.

- Improve log readability in deployed applications: Log output from deployed MooseStack applications now displays without ANSI color codes for cleaner, more readable logs in the dashboard. ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
- Update moose to 0.6.365: Updated the underlying moose framework to version 0.6.365, bringing the latest improvements and fixes to the Boreal platform. ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
- Replace old logs interface with improved new logs system: The logs interface in the project dashboard has been updated with a new, improved system that replaces the previous logging implementation. ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))
- Improve command center navigation with group organization: The command center now organizes commands into groups with drill-down navigation, adds a "New Project" command, and shows command counts for better discoverability. ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))

### Bug Fixes
- Temporarily disable one-click deploy for MCP template: Temporarily disabled the one-click deploy feature for the TypeScript MCP template in Boreal. PR: [#3442](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3442) ([@onelesd](https://github.com/onelesd))

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
**Move workflow routes behind admin authentication** ([@DatGuyJonathan](https://github.com/DatGuyJonathan))
  Workflow API endpoints now require admin authentication for security. The workflow trigger and history endpoints have been moved under `/admin/` paths and require a valid admin bearer token. This affects users who programmatically trigger workflows or query workflow history - they'll need to update their API calls to include proper authentication headers and use the new admin endpoints.

  **Updating workflow API calls for admin authentication**

  ```typescript
  // Before: Workflow operations without authentication
  // const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4000/workflows/my-pipeline/trigger', {
  //   method: 'POST',
  //   body: JSON.stringify({ data: userData })
  // });
  
  // After: Workflow operations require admin authentication
  const ADMIN_TOKEN = process.env.MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN; // Set your admin bearer token
  
  // Trigger a workflow with admin authentication
  async function triggerDataPipeline(workflowName: string, inputData: any) {
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/admin/workflows/${workflowName}/trigger`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(inputData)
    });
  
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to trigger workflow: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
  
    return response.json();
  }
  
  // Query workflow execution history with admin authentication
  async function getWorkflowHistory(workflowName?: string) {
    const url = workflowName 
      ? `http://localhost:4000/admin/workflows/history?workflow_name=${workflowName}`
      : 'http://localhost:4000/admin/workflows/history';
  
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}`
      }
    });
  
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch workflow history: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
  
    return response.json();
  }
  
  // Example usage
  await triggerDataPipeline('user-analytics-pipeline', { userId: '12345', event: 'signup' });
  const history = await getWorkflowHistory('user-analytics-pipeline');
  ```

  This example shows how to update existing workflow API calls to use the new admin-protected endpoints. All workflow trigger and history operations now require admin authentication via bearer token and use `/admin/` prefixed routes.
