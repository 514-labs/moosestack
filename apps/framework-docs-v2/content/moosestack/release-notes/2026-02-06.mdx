### New Documentation

**RFC: Multi-Engine and Remote-First Developer Experience**

Published a decision-complete RFC that defines the product contract for:

- engine selection across ClickHouse, DuckDB, and Snowflake
- remote-first development workflows for ClickHouse Cloud and Redpanda Cloud
- common-core compatibility model and backward-compatibility/deprecation policy

RFC: [rfd/0010/README.mdx](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/blob/main/rfd/0010/README.mdx)

**Remote-First and Multi-Engine Docs Pack**

Published user-facing docs that map directly to the RFC contract:

- [Remote-First Quickstart](/moosestack/getting-started/remote-first-quickstart)
- [Engine and Dev Profile](/moosestack/configuration/engine-and-dev-profile)
- [Engine Capability Matrix](/moosestack/reference/engine-capability-matrix)
- [Multi-Engine Migration Playbooks](/moosestack/migrate/multi-engine-migration-playbooks)

Also updated MooseStack navigation and index pages to surface these guides from core entry points.
