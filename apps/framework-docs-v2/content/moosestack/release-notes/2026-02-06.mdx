### New Features
**Live logs view with automatic fallback** ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
  New live logs view showing the last 15 minutes of logs with real-time updates every second. Automatically falls back from structured logs to legacy parsed logs when needed for compatibility during the transition.

**Track Moose CLI versions in deployments** ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
  Deployments now track and display the Moose CLI version used to build them, making it easier to troubleshoot version-related issues.


**Streamlined project creation with one-click deployment** ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))
  Redesigned project creation flow with a multi-step wizard covering repository selection, data services configuration, and deployment settings. Supports both GitHub repository imports and template-based deployments.

### Improvements
- Skip building projects with no relevant changes in PRs, reducing unnecessary build times. ([@onelesd](https://github.com/onelesd))
- Strip ANSI color codes from deployed application logs for cleaner readability in the dashboard. ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
- Update moose to 0.6.362. ([@LucioFranco](https://github.com/LucioFranco))
- Replace old logs interface with the new structured logs system. ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))
- Organize command center into groups with drill-down navigation, add a "New Project" command, and show command counts. ([@groy-514](https://github.com/groy-514))

### Bug Fixes
- Temporarily disable one-click deploy for the TypeScript MCP template. PR: [#3442](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3442) ([@onelesd](https://github.com/onelesd))
- Fix validation and type handling in environment variable management that could cause errors when updating project configurations. ([@georgevanderson](https://github.com/georgevanderson))

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
**Move workflow routes behind admin authentication** ([@DatGuyJonathan](https://github.com/DatGuyJonathan))
  Workflow trigger, history, and terminate endpoints have moved under `/admin/` and now require a bearer token. Authentication is enforced in both dev and production modes.

  **Migration example**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  fetch('http://localhost:4000/workflows/my-pipeline/trigger', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });

  // After — all workflow routes require admin auth
  const ADMIN_TOKEN = process.env.MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN;

  fetch('http://localhost:4000/admin/workflows/my-pipeline/trigger', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });

  // History endpoint also moved
  fetch('http://localhost:4000/admin/workflows/history', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}` }
  });
  ```

### New Features
**Language Server documentation for IDE integration** ([@onelesd](https://github.com/onelesd))

**Feedback command for submitting issues and joining community** ([@oatsandsugar](https://github.com/oatsandsugar))
  New `moose feedback` command with three modes:
  - `moose feedback "message"` — sends feedback directly via telemetry
  - `moose feedback --bug "description"` — opens GitHub Issues pre-filled with environment info and log paths
  - `moose feedback --community` — opens Slack community invite
