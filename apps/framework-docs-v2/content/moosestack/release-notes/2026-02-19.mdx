## 🐻 Boreal

### New Features
**Real-time deployment status monitoring with live Kubernetes updates** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Added a comprehensive deployment status monitoring system that provides real-time updates on your application deployments. The system now actively monitors pod health, container status, and deployment progress, immediately surfacing issues like crash loops or image pull failures. Deployment statuses are pushed proactively when changes occur, eliminating the need for manual polling and providing instant visibility into your infrastructure health.

**Deploy branches on git push without requiring pull requests** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Branch deployments can now be triggered by pushing to any branch in your repository, not just through pull request workflows. This streamlines the development workflow by automatically creating preview environments for feature branches as soon as code is pushed, enabling faster iteration and testing of changes before opening a PR.

**New Boreal CLI with setup and link commands for project onboarding** (Lucio Franco)
  Introduced the new Boreal CLI with comprehensive project setup capabilities. The `boreal setup <org>/<project>` command clones projects locally with optional branch creation and deployment setup. The `boreal link` command connects existing local repositories to Boreal projects for streamlined deployment workflows. Both commands support authentication, interactive and non-interactive modes, and provide clear guidance for next steps in the development workflow.

  **Boreal CLI setup and link commands for project onboarding**

  ```bash
  # Clone and set up a new project from Boreal
  boreal setup acme/analytics-api --path ./my-analytics-app --branch feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd my-analytics-app
  
  # The setup command automatically:
  # - Clones the repository
  # - Creates the specified branch
  # - Links the repo to Boreal project
  # - Sets up deployment configuration
  
  # Make your changes
  echo "console.log('Hello from analytics API');" > src/index.js
  
  # Push changes to trigger deployment
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add initial analytics endpoint"
  git push origin feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Link an existing local repository to a Boreal project
  cd /path/to/existing/repo
  boreal link --project acme/marketing-dashboard --yes
  
  # Or use interactive mode to select from available projects
  boreal link
  
  # Check deployment status in Boreal dashboard
  echo "View deployment: https://fiveonefour.boreal.cloud/acme/analytics-api/deployments"
  ```

  This example shows the complete workflow for using the new Boreal CLI commands to set up new projects and link existing repositories. The setup command handles cloning, branch creation, and deployment configuration, while the link command connects existing local repos to Boreal projects for streamlined deployments.

**Environment isolation and preview deployment controls** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Implemented comprehensive environment isolation to prevent production data corruption when using the same GitHub app across production and preview environments. Added safeguards for production organizations in preview environments, webhook fanout to preview deployments for testing, and controls to prevent deployment race conditions between environments. The 514-demos organization and new preview organizations can now safely perform deployments in their respective environments.

**Enable TypeScript MCP template for one-click deployment** (Dave Seleno)
  The TypeScript MCP template is now available for one-click deployment in Boreal, allowing users to quickly deploy an AI chat app that can query their data using the Model Context Protocol integration.

  PR: [#3478](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3478)

**Add CLI docs command for in-terminal documentation access** (Lucio Franco)
  Added a new `docs` command to the hosting CLI that allows users to browse and read documentation directly from the terminal. Users can view the table of contents with `docs`, read specific pages with `docs <slug>`, view page sections with `docs <slug>#<section>`, and search documentation with `docs search <query>`. The command supports both tree and raw output formats, making documentation accessible without leaving the command line.

  **Using the CLI docs command for in-terminal documentation**

  ```bash
  # View the complete documentation table of contents
  moose docs
  
  # Browse a specific documentation page
  moose docs moosestack/data-modeling
  
  # View a specific section of a guide
  moose docs moosestack/olap/model-table#streaming-imports
  
  # Search through all documentation
  moose docs search "aggregation functions"
  
  # Expand the table of contents to show all pages
  moose docs --expand
  
  # Get raw output (useful for scripts or piping)
  moose docs --raw
  
  # View sections available in a specific guide
  moose docs moosestack/streaming/consumption  # Shows H2 and H3 headings
  
  # Chain commands to find and read documentation
  moose docs search "PostgreSQL" | head -5
  moose docs database/postgresql-integration
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new CLI docs command to browse MooseStack documentation directly from the terminal. Users can view the table of contents, read specific pages, jump to sections within guides, and search across all documentation without leaving their command line.

**Add update command to 514 CLI** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added a new `514 update` command that allows users to update both the 514 and moose CLIs to their latest versions. The CLI now also automatically checks for updates and displays notifications when newer versions are available, helping users stay current with the latest features and fixes.

  **Using the 514 update command to keep CLIs current**

  ```bash
  # Update both 514 and moose CLIs to latest versions
  514 update
  
  # Update only the 514 CLI
  514 update 514
  
  # Update only the moose CLI
  514 update moose
  
  # The CLI also checks for updates automatically and shows notifications
  # when running other commands (unless in JSON mode or disabled)
  514 deploy my-app
  # Output might include: "A newer 514 CLI is available: v1.2.3 (current: v1.2.0). Run: 514 update 514"
  
  # Disable automatic update checks if needed
  export HOSTING_CLI_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true
  514 deploy my-app  # No update notification will be shown
  
  # Customize update check frequency (in seconds, default is 24 hours)
  export HOSTING_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK_TTL_SECONDS=3600  # Check every hour
  514 status
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new 514 update command to keep your CLI tools current. The command can update both CLIs together or individually, and includes automatic update notifications to help users stay informed about new versions.

**Start developing feature now available to all users** (groy-514)
  The "Start Developing" feature, which provides guided steps to help users begin development on their MooseStack projects, is now available to all users without experimental flags. This feature appears in deployment details pages and branch management sections, making it easier for users to get started with their projects.

**Boreal CLI distribution and installation system** (Nicolas Joseph)
  The Boreal CLI is now available for distribution with automated builds for multiple platforms (Linux x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64), code signing for security, and a streamlined installation process. Users can now easily install and use the CLI to manage their Boreal projects and deployments across different operating systems.

**Add node details panel to lineage view with improved UI** (groy-514)
  Added a new node details panel to the lineage visualization that shows detailed information when clicking on nodes. The lineage view now includes smooth animations for better visual feedback, and the Boreal logo in the header is now clickable to navigate back to projects. Also fixed a bug where logs filters from URL parameters weren't working correctly on initial page load.

**Add organization management commands to Boreal CLI** (Lucio Franco)
  The Boreal CLI now includes organization management capabilities with `boreal orgs list` to view all accessible organizations and `boreal orgs switch` to change the active organization context. This enables users to manage multiple organizations directly from the command line without needing to use the web interface.

  **Managing Organizations with Boreal CLI**

  ```bash
  # List all accessible organizations
  boreal orgs list
  
  # Output shows organizations with current one marked with *:
  # ID                                   NAME           SLUG
  # org_123abc...def                    Acme Corp      acme-corp      *
  # org_456ghi...jkl                    DevTeam Inc    devteam-inc
  
  # Switch to a different organization by name
  boreal orgs switch "DevTeam Inc"
  # Output: Switched to organization: DevTeam Inc (devteam-inc)
  
  # Switch using organization slug
  boreal orgs switch devteam-inc
  
  # Switch using organization ID
  boreal orgs switch org_456ghi...jkl
  
  # List organizations in JSON format for scripting
  boreal orgs list --json > organizations.json
  
  # Verify current organization context
  boreal auth whoami
  # Shows current user and active organization
  ```

  This example shows the complete workflow for managing organizations using the new Boreal CLI commands. Users can list all accessible organizations, switch between them using various identifiers (name, slug, or ID), and verify their current context.

**CLI authentication with Clerk API keys** (Lucio Franco)
  Added authentication support for the Boreal CLI using Clerk API keys. Users can now authenticate their CLI sessions through a web-based flow that opens in their browser and generates secure API keys for CLI access. This enables secure command-line interactions with Boreal projects and services.

  **Authenticating Boreal CLI with browser-based login flow**

  ```bash
  # First, authenticate your CLI session
  boreal auth login
  
  # This opens a browser window for secure authentication
  # After successful login, your session is authenticated
  
  # Now you can use authenticated CLI commands
  boreal project list
  
  # Deploy your changes to production
  boreal deploy --environment production
  
  # View your project status
  boreal status
  
  # Check authentication status anytime
  boreal auth status
  
  # Logout when needed
  boreal auth logout
  ```

  Shows the complete authentication flow for the Boreal CLI using Clerk API keys. Users run 'boreal auth login' which opens a browser for secure authentication, then can use all CLI commands that require authentication like deploying projects and managing environments.

**Add "Get Started Developing" panel to deployment details page** (groy-514)
  Added a new "Get Started Developing" section to deployment pages that provides step-by-step guidance for cloning projects, creating branches, and starting development. This panel helps users quickly set up their local development environment after viewing deployments.

  📸 *[Screenshot needed: Added a new "Get Started Developing" section to deployment pages that provides step-by-step guidance for cloning projects, creating branches, and starting development. This panel helps users quickly set up their local development environment after viewing deployments.]*

**Add Vercel integration for automated deployments** (George Anderson)
  Users can now connect their Vercel projects to Boreal for automated deployments and environment variable synchronization. This integration allows teams to link their Vercel projects with their data applications, enabling seamless deployment workflows and automatic environment configuration management.

**Add new `ops` CLI tool for operations tasks** (Lucio Franco)
  Added a new CLI tool called `ops` for Boreal operations tasks. The tool provides a foundation for deployment, maintenance, and other operational commands, with an install script that makes it globally available on user systems.

  **Using the new ops CLI tool for Boreal operations**

  ```bash
  # Install the ops CLI tool globally
  pnpm ops:install
  
  # Verify installation worked
  ops --version
  # Output: 0.0.1
  
  # View available commands and options
  ops --help
  # Output: 
  # Boreal Operations CLI
  # 
  # Usage: ops [options] [command]
  # 
  # Options:
  #   -V, --version   display version number
  #   -h, --help      display help for command
  
  # Example of adding a custom deployment command
  # In your ops CLI extension:
  ops deploy --environment production --branch main
  
  # Example of adding a maintenance command
  ops maintenance --mode enable --duration 30m
  
  # The CLI is built on Commander.js, so you can extend it
  # by adding new commands to src/cli.ts following the pattern:
  #
  # program
  #   .command("deploy")
  #   .description("Deploy application to specified environment")
  #   .option("-e, --environment <env>", "Target environment")
  #   .option("-b, --branch <branch>", "Git branch to deploy")
  #   .action(async (options) => {
  #     console.log(`Deploying ${options.branch} to ${options.environment}...`);
  #   });
  ```

  This example shows how to install and use the new ops CLI tool for Boreal operations tasks. The CLI provides a foundation for deployment, maintenance, and other operational commands that can be extended with custom functionality.

### Improvements

## 🦌 Moose

### New Features
**Application logging documentation for Moose apps** (Lucio Franco)
  Added comprehensive documentation for logging within Moose applications. Developers can now use standard console methods in TypeScript or print/logging module in Python to generate structured JSON logs. The logs are automatically enriched with context like API names and request IDs, making them easy to trace and filter in log aggregation systems.

  PR: [#3481](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3481), [#1405](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1405), [#1427](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1427) | Docs: [/moosestack/metrics](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/metrics)

**Add lifecycle management support to materialized views** (Dave Seleno)
  Materialized views now support lifecycle management with three options: FULLY_MANAGED (default - Moose manages creation, updates, and deletion), DELETION_PROTECTED (prevents accidental deletion and updates), and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED (user manages the view outside of Moose). This gives users fine-grained control over how their materialized views are managed in production environments.

  **Materialized View Lifecycle Management Options**

  ```typescript
  import { MaterializedView, LifeCycle, Key, DateTime } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
  import { UserActivity } from "../ingest/models";
  
  // Define the aggregated data structure
  interface UserActivitySummary {
    userId: Key<string>;
    totalEvents: number;
    lastActivity: DateTime;
  }
  
  const userActivityTable = UserActivity.table!;
  
  // FULLY_MANAGED (default) - Moose handles everything
  export const userSummaryMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "UserActivitySummary",
    targetTable: {
      name: "UserActivitySummaryTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId", "lastActivity"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT 
        userId,
        count() as totalEvents,
        max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    // lifeCycle defaults to FULLY_MANAGED - Moose creates, updates, and deletes
  });
  
  // DELETION_PROTECTED - Prevents accidental deletion or updates
  export const criticalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "CriticalUserReport", 
    targetTable: {
      name: "CriticalUserReportTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT userId, count() as totalEvents, max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      WHERE userId IN (SELECT userId FROM premium_users)
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.DELETION_PROTECTED, // Prevents drops/updates
  });
  
  // EXTERNALLY_MANAGED - User manages the view outside of Moose
  export const externalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "ExternalUserReport",
    targetTable: {
      name: "ExternalUserReportTable", 
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `SELECT userId, 0 as totalEvents, now() as lastActivity FROM users`,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED, // Moose won't create or manage this view
  });
  ```

  This example shows how to use the three lifecycle management options for materialized views: FULLY_MANAGED (default) for automatic management, DELETION_PROTECTED to prevent accidental changes to critical views, and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED for views managed outside of Moose.

**Add comprehensive documentation for externally managed tables** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added extensive documentation for working with CDC-enabled ClickHouse databases and externally managed tables, including configuration options for local development mirrors, remote connections, and a complete guide for building on existing CDC pipelines like ClickPipes, PeerDB, and Debezium.

  PR: [#3492](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3492) | Docs: [/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables)

**Add external table mirroring in dev mode** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Developers can now automatically create local mirror tables for externally managed tables during development. When enabled via `create_local_mirrors = true` in moose.config.toml, the dev server will mirror remote table schemas and optionally sample data to local ClickHouse, making it easier to develop and test with external data sources without requiring direct access to production systems.

  **Enable external table mirroring in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml
  [project]
  name = "my-analytics-app"
  
  # ClickHouse configuration for local development
  [clickhouse]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9000
  db_name = "analytics_dev"
  
  # Development mode configuration
  [dev.externally_managed.tables]
  # Enable automatic creation of local mirror tables for external tables
  create_local_mirrors = true
  
  # Number of sample rows to copy from remote tables (0 = schema only)
  sample_size = 1000
  
  # Whether to refresh mirrors on startup (drop and recreate)
  refresh_on_startup = true
  
  # Optional: Remote ClickHouse connection for mirroring
  [clickhouse.remote]
  url = "https://production-clickhouse.company.com:8443"
  # username and password stored securely via keyring
  ```

  This configuration enables external table mirroring in development mode. When enabled, the dev server automatically creates local mirror tables for any EXTERNALLY_MANAGED tables, optionally copying sample data from production systems to make local development easier.

**Add short aliases for all CLI commands** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  All CLI commands now support short aliases for faster command line usage. For example, you can use `moose d` instead of `moose dev`, `moose b` instead of `moose build`, and many others. This improves developer productivity by reducing typing while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing commands.

  **Using Moose CLI Short Aliases for Faster Development**

  ```bash
  # Initialize a new Moose project using short alias
  moose i my-analytics-app
  cd my-analytics-app
  
  # Start development environment with short alias
  moose d
  
  # Build the project using short alias  
  moose b
  
  # Check project for errors using short alias
  moose c
  
  # View data from a table using short alias
  moose pk user_events --limit 10
  
  # Generate API tokens using short alias
  moose g hash-token --json
  
  # View logs in real-time using short alias
  moose l --follow
  
  # Clean up development environment using short alias
  moose cl
  
  # Run a workflow using short alias
  moose w r data-processing --input '{"batch_size": 1000}'
  
  # Query ClickHouse directly using short alias
  moose q "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_events WHERE created_at > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY"
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new short aliases for common Moose CLI commands during a typical development workflow. The aliases reduce typing while maintaining the same functionality as the full command names, improving developer productivity when building data pipelines.

**Add remote ClickHouse database configuration and secure credential storage** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Users can now configure remote ClickHouse databases in their moose.config.toml file and connect to external ClickHouse instances. The CLI securely stores database credentials in the OS keychain and prompts for them when needed, enabling teams to work with hosted ClickHouse databases instead of only local Docker instances.

  **Configure remote ClickHouse in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml - Configure your MooseStack project
  
  [project]
  name = "analytics-pipeline"
  language = "typescript"
  
  # Configure remote ClickHouse database connection
  [dev.remote_clickhouse]
  host = "clickhouse.company.com"
  port = 8443
  database = "analytics_db"
  protocol = "http"
  use_ssl = true
  
  # Other configuration sections
  [docker]
  enabled = false  # Disable local Docker when using remote ClickHouse
  
  [kafka]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9092
  ```

  This example shows how to configure a remote ClickHouse database in the moose.config.toml file. When you run `moose dev`, the CLI will securely prompt for and store your database credentials in the OS keychain, enabling your team to connect to hosted ClickHouse instances instead of local Docker containers.

**Add interactive browsing and web integration to `moose docs`** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  The `moose docs` command now supports interactive browsing with `moose docs browse`, section-level navigation for guides using anchors (e.g., `moose docs guides/chat-in-your-app#overview`), and a `--web` flag to open documentation pages directly in your browser. This makes it easier to explore and navigate the documentation from the command line.

  **Enhanced moose docs with interactive browsing and web support**

  ```bash
  # View the main documentation index
  moose docs
  
  # Browse documentation interactively and select a page
  moose docs browse
  
  # Open a specific page in your browser instead of terminal
  moose docs moosestack/olap --web
  
  # Navigate to a specific section of a guide
  moose docs guides/chat-in-your-app#setup
  
  # Search for documentation pages
  moose docs search "materialized views"
  
  # View Python-specific documentation 
  moose docs --lang py moosestack/data-modeling
  
  # Get raw markdown output for scripting
  moose docs moosestack/olap --raw | grep "CREATE TABLE"
  
  # Interactive browsing with web integration
  moose docs browse --web  # Select page and open in browser
  
  # View expanded documentation tree
  moose docs --expand
  ```

  This example demonstrates the enhanced `moose docs` command with interactive browsing, section-level navigation using anchors, and web integration. Users can now browse docs interactively, jump to specific guide sections, and open documentation directly in their browser from the command line.

**Add GuideStepper interactive documentation component with checkpoint workflow** (Olivia Kane)
  Documentation authors can now create multi-phase interactive guides using the new GuideStepper component. Each phase contains checkpoints that users can mark complete, with a "Copy Prompt" feature that concatenates checkpoint content into markdown for use with AI coding assistants. This enables more structured, workflow-oriented documentation that integrates with developer tooling.

**Add generate dockerfile command for Docker customization** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Added new `moose generate dockerfile` command that creates a customizable Dockerfile without building Docker images. This allows developers to generate and modify the Dockerfile for their deployment needs before running the build process. The command requires `custom_dockerfile = true` in moose.config.toml and places the Dockerfile at the configured path (default: ./Dockerfile).

  **Generate and customize Dockerfile for Moose deployment**

  ```bash
  # First, enable custom dockerfile mode in your moose.config.toml
  cat >> moose.config.toml << EOF
  [docker_config]
  custom_dockerfile = true
  dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
  EOF
  
  # Generate the Dockerfile without building images
  moose generate dockerfile
  
  # Now you can customize the generated Dockerfile
  # Add custom dependencies, caching layers, etc.
  cat >> Dockerfile << EOF
  
  # Add custom dependencies
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\
      curl \\
      jq \\
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  
  # Add custom environment variables
  ENV CUSTOM_CONFIG_PATH=/app/config
  EOF
  
  # Build the Docker image with your customizations
  moose build --docker
  
  # Or build for specific architecture
  moose build --docker --amd64
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new generate dockerfile command to create a customizable Dockerfile for a Moose data pipeline project. The workflow demonstrates enabling custom dockerfile mode, generating the base Dockerfile, customizing it with additional dependencies, and building the final Docker image.

**Custom Dockerfile support for Docker deployments** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Moose now supports custom Dockerfiles for deployment packaging. Enable `custom_dockerfile = true` in moose.config.toml or use the `--custom-dockerfile` flag during project initialization to have Moose generate a Dockerfile in your project root that you can customize. This allows you to add system dependencies, configure caching, or adjust build stages while still using `moose build --docker` to build images.

  **Enable custom Dockerfile in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml
  name = "my-analytics-platform"
  
  [database_config]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 5432
  database = "analytics"
  
  [infrastructure]
  olap = true
  streaming = true
  
  # Enable custom Dockerfile for deployment
  [docker_config]
  custom_dockerfile = true
  dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
  ```

  This example shows how to enable custom Dockerfile support in a Moose project by setting custom_dockerfile = true in moose.config.toml. Once enabled, running 'moose build --docker' will generate a Dockerfile in your project root that you can customize with additional dependencies or build steps.

**Add optional email to moose feedback command** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  The moose feedback command now supports an optional --email flag to provide your email address for follow-up responses. If no email is provided via the flag, users are interactively prompted to optionally enter one. Email validation is included with retry options for invalid addresses.

  **Using moose feedback with optional email support**

  ```bash
  # Basic feedback without email
  moose feedback "The streaming aggregations are working perfectly!"
  
  # Feedback with email for follow-up
  moose feedback "Would love to see more Python examples in docs" --email developer@company.com
  
  # Interactive feedback (will prompt for optional email)
  moose feedback "Great performance improvements in v0.3!"
  # Output: Your email (optional, press Enter to skip):
  # > user@example.com
  
  # Report a bug with email
  moose feedback "Memory leak in aggregation processing" --bug
  
  # Join the community
  moose feedback --community
  
  # Get help with all feedback options
  moose feedback
  ```

  Demonstrates the enhanced moose feedback command with optional email functionality. Shows how users can provide feedback with or without email addresses, either via the --email flag or interactive prompts, enabling better follow-up on user issues and suggestions.

## 📦 infrastructure

### Improvements
- Improve deployment reliability by always pulling latest images: Deployments now always pull the latest version of container images tagged with ":latest", ensuring users get the most up-to-date application versions and preventing issues with cached outdated images. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Reduce deployment startup times from 20 minutes to 3.5 minutes: Application deployments now start up significantly faster with reduced startup probe failure thresholds and timeout values. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve deployment performance and multi-tenant isolation: Moose deployments now start faster by preferring pre-warmed nodes when available, and multi-tenant environments get stronger isolation to prevent performance interference between organizations. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Improve deployment availability during system maintenance: Moose deployments now remain available during planned system maintenance and node upgrades through automatic pod disruption management. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Faster deployment startup times with cluster warm pool: Moose deployments now start significantly faster by using pre-warmed nodes that are ready to run applications immediately. (Mitchell Suzuki)
