## 🐻 Boreal

### New Features
**Deploy branches on git push without requiring pull requests** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Branch deployments can now be triggered by pushing to any branch in your repository, not just through pull request workflows. This streamlines the development workflow by automatically creating preview environments for feature branches as soon as code is pushed, enabling faster iteration and testing of changes before opening a PR.

**New Boreal CLI with setup and link commands for project onboarding** (Lucio Franco)
  Introduced the new Boreal CLI with comprehensive project setup capabilities. The `boreal setup <org>/<project>` command clones projects locally with optional branch creation and deployment setup. The `boreal link` command connects existing local repositories to Boreal projects for streamlined deployment workflows. Both commands support authentication, interactive and non-interactive modes, and provide clear guidance for next steps in the development workflow.

  **Boreal CLI setup and link commands for project onboar
  ```bash
  # Clone and set up a new project from Boreal
  boreal setup acme/analytics-api --path ./my-analytics-app --branch feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd my-analytics-app
  
  # The setup command automatically:
  # - Clones the repository
  # - Creates the specified branch
  # - Links the repo to Boreal project
  # - Sets up deployment configuration
  
  # Make your changes
  echo "console.log('Hello from analytics API');" > src/index.js
  
  # Push changes to trigger deployment
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add initial analytics endpoint"
  git push origin feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Link an existing local repository to a Boreal project
  cd /path/to/existing/repo
  boreal link --project acme/marketing-dashboard --yes
  
  # Or use interactive mode to select from available projects
  boreal link
  
  # Check deployment status in Boreal dashboard
  echo "View deployment: https://fiveonefour.boreal.cloud/acme/analytics-api/deployments"
  ```

  This example shows the complete workflow for using the new Boreal CLI commands to set up new projects and link existing repositories. The setup command handles cloning, branch creation, and deployment configuration, while the link command connects existing local repos to Boreal projects for streamlined deployments.

**Enable TypeScript MCP template for one-click deployment** (Dave Seleno)
  The TypeScript MCP template is now available for one-click deployment in Boreal, allowing users to quickly deploy an AI chat app that can query their data using the Model Context Protocol integration.

  PR: [#3478](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3478)

**Add update command to 514 CLI** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added a new `514 update` command that allows users to update both the 514 and moose CLIs to their latest versions. The CLI now also automatically checks for updates and displays notifications when newer versions are available, helping users stay current with the latest features and fixes.

  **Using the 514 update command to keep CLIs current**

  ```bash
  # Update both 514 and moose CLIs to latest versions
  514 update
  
  # Update only the 514 CLI
  514 update 514
  
  # Update only the moose CLI
  514 update moose
  
  # The CLI also checks for updates automatically and shows notifications
  # when running other commands (unless in JSON mode or disabled)
  514 deploy my-app
  # Output might include: "A newer 514 CLI is available: v1.2.3 (current: v1.2.0). Run: 514 update 514"
  
  # Disable automatic update checks if needed
  export HOSTING_CLI_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true
  514 deploy my-app  # No update notification will be shown
  
  # Customize update check frequency (in seconds, default is 24 hours)
  export HOSTING_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK_TTL_SECONDS=3600  # Check every hour
  514 status
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new 514 update command to keep your CLI tools current. The command can update both CLIs together or individually, and includes automatic update notifications to help users stay informed about new versions.

**Start developing feature now available to all users** (groy-514)
  The "Start Developing" feature, which provides guided steps to help users begin development on their MooseStack projects, is now available to all users without experimental flags. This feature appears in deployment details pages and branch management sections, making it easier for users to get started with their projects.

### Improvements
- Faster template deployments using pre-built images: Template-based projects now deploy immediately using pre-built Docker images instead of waiting for the build process to complete, significantly reducing deployment time for new projects. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Rebrand from Boreal to Fiveonefour Hosting throughout the platform: Updated all user-facing text, logos, and branding elements from "Boreal" to "Fiveonefour Hosting" across the entire platform interface. (groy-514)
- Improve CLI project selection with URLs and IDs: The CLI now accepts project URLs, UUIDs, and bare project names in addition to org/project slug format when selecting projects. (Lucio Franco)
- Streamline organization selection during CLI login: The CLI now automatically prompts users to select an organization after login, and auto-selects when only one organization is available, eliminating the need for separate org switch commands. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve CLI messaging with modern formatting: CLI commands now use cleaner formatting with checkmarks, better error messages, and more helpful guidance for next steps. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve organization switching with visual feedback: Organization switching now shows a loading screen with progress feedback and disables UI interactions during the switch to prevent conflicts. (groy-514)
- Add clarifying note for existing database option: Added a helpful note explaining that existing tables remain unchanged when using an existing ClickHouse database for new projects. (groy-514)
- Improve branch page layout with better text truncation: The branch pages top bar now properly handles long repository names and URLs with improved text truncation and responsive layout. (groy-514)
- Improve project creation flow with enhanced step transitions and visual feedback: The project creation wizard now provides better visual feedback with a loading spinner on the deploy button, smoother step transitions with animations, and error-only display for deployment steps, making the project setup process clearer and more intuitive. (groy-514)
- Remove GitHub authentication requirement for project creation: Users can now create projects from templates without being blocked by GitHub authentication requirements, streamlining the project creation flow. (groy-514)
- Faster deployment times with cluster node warming: Deployments now start faster by pre-warming cluster nodes and scheduling applications on ready infrastructure, reducing cold start delays. (Mitchell Suzuki)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix logs with identical timestamps and content selecting together: Fixed an issue in the logs viewer where multiple log entries with the same timestamp and content would all be selected when clicking on one. PR: [#3481](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3481), [#1405](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1405), [#1427](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1427) (Lucio Franco)

- Fix duplicate deployments during template project creation: Fixed an issue where template projects would trigger duplicate deployments due to race conditions between project creation and push webhooks. (Dave Seleno)

## 🦌 Moose

### New Features
**Application logging documentation for Moose apps** (Lucio Franco)
  Added comprehensive documentation for logging within Moose applications. Developers can now use standard console methods in TypeScript or print/logging module in Python to generate structured JSON logs. The logs are automatically enriched with context like API names and request IDs, making them easy to trace and filter in log aggregation systems.

  PR: [#3481](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3481), [#1405](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1405), [#1427](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1427) | Docs: [/moosestack/metrics](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/metrics)

**Add lifecycle management support to materialized views** (Dave Seleno)
  Materialized views now support lifecycle management with three options: FULLY_MANAGED (default - Moose manages creation, updates, and deletion), DELETION_PROTECTED (prevents accidental deletion and updates), and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED (user manages the view outside of Moose). This gives users fine-grained control over how their materialized views are managed in production environments.

  **Materialized View Lifecycle Management Options**

  ```typescript
  import { MaterializedView, LifeCycle, Key, DateTime } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
  import { UserActivity } from "../ingest/models";
  
  // Define the aggregated data structure
  interface UserActivitySummary {
    userId: Key<string>;
    totalEvents: number;
    lastActivity: DateTime;
  }
  
  const userActivityTable = UserActivity.table!;
  
  // FULLY_MANAGED (default) - Moose handles everything
  export const userSummaryMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "UserActivitySummary",
    targetTable: {
      name: "UserActivitySummaryTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId", "lastActivity"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT 
        userId,
        count() as totalEvents,
        max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    // lifeCycle defaults to FULLY_MANAGED - Moose creates, updates, and deletes
  });
  
  // DELETION_PROTECTED - Prevents accidental deletion or updates
  export const criticalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "CriticalUserReport", 
    targetTable: {
      name: "CriticalUserReportTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT userId, count() as totalEvents, max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      WHERE userId IN (SELECT userId FROM premium_users)
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.DELETION_PROTECTED, // Prevents drops/updates
  });
  
  // EXTERNALLY_MANAGED - User manages the view outside of Moose
  export const externalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "ExternalUserReport",
    targetTable: {
      name: "ExternalUserReportTable", 
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `SELECT userId, 0 as totalEvents, now() as lastActivity FROM users`,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED, // Moose won't create or manage this view
  });
  ```

  This example shows how to use the three lifecycle management options for materialized views: FULLY_MANAGED (default) for automatic management, DELETION_PROTECTED to prevent accidental changes to critical views, and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED for views managed outside of Moose.

**Add Windows Setup documentation** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  Added comprehensive Windows setup guide for MooseStack using WSL2. The new documentation provides step-by-step instructions for Windows users to set up WSL2, Docker Desktop, Node.js, and MooseStack on their systems.

  PR: [#3566](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3566) | Docs: [/moosestack/help/windows-setup](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/help/windows-setup)

**Add comprehensive documentation for externally managed tables** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added extensive documentation for working with CDC-enabled ClickHouse databases and externally managed tables, including configuration options for local development mirrors, remote connections, and a complete guide for building on existing CDC pipelines like ClickPipes, PeerDB, and Debezium.

  PR: [#3492](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3492) | Docs: [/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables)

**Add external table mirroring in dev mode** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Developers can now automatically create local mirror tables for externally managed tables during development. When enabled via `create_local_mirrors = true` in moose.config.toml, the dev server will mirror remote table schemas and optionally sample data to local ClickHouse, making it easier to develop and test with external data sources without requiring direct access to production systems.

  **Enable external table mirroring in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml
  [project]
  name = "my-analytics-app"
  
  # ClickHouse configuration for local development
  [clickhouse]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9000
  db_name = "analytics_dev"
  
  # Development mode configuration
  [dev.externally_managed.tables]
  # Enable automatic creation of local mirror tables for external tables
  create_local_mirrors = true
  
  # Number of sample rows to copy from remote tables (0 = schema only)
  sample_size = 1000
  
  # Whether to refresh mirrors on startup (drop and recreate)
  refresh_on_startup = true
  
  # Optional: Remote ClickHouse connection for mirroring
  [clickhouse.remote]
  url = "https://production-clickhouse.company.com:8443"
  # username and password stored securely via keyring
  ```

  This configuration enables external table mirroring in development mode. When enabled, the dev server automatically creates local mirror tables for any EXTERNALLY_MANAGED tables, optionally copying sample data from production systems to make local development easier.

  PR: [#3491](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3491) | Docs: [/moosestack/data-modeling](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/data-modeling)

**Add short aliases for all CLI commands** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  All CLI commands now support short aliases for faster command line usage. For example, you can use `moose d` instead of `moose dev`, `moose b` instead of `moose build`, and many others. This improves developer productivity by reducing typing while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing commands.

  **Using Moose CLI Short Aliases for Faster Development**

  ```bash
  # Initialize a new Moose project using short alias
  moose i my-analytics-app
  cd my-analytics-app
  
  # Start development environment with short alias
  moose d
  
  # Build the project using short alias  
  moose b
  
  # Check project for errors using short alias
  moose c
  
  # View data from a table using short alias
  moose pk user_events --limit 10
  
  # Generate API tokens using short alias
  moose g hash-token --json
  
  # View logs in real-time using short alias
  moose l --follow
  
  # Clean up development environment using short alias
  moose cl
  
  # Run a workflow using short alias
  moose w r data-processing --input '{"batch_size": 1000}'
  
  # Query ClickHouse directly using short alias
  moose q "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_events WHERE created_at > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY"
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new short aliases for common Moose CLI commands during a typical development workflow. The aliases reduce typing while maintaining the same functionality as the full command names, improving developer productivity when building data pipelines.

  PR: [#3497](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3497) | Docs: [/moosestack/moose-cli](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/moose-cli)

**Add remote ClickHouse database configuration and secure credential storage** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Users can now configure remote ClickHouse databases in their moose.config.toml file and connect to external ClickHouse instances. The CLI securely stores database credentials in the OS keychain and prompts for them when needed, enabling teams to work with hosted ClickHouse databases instead of only local Docker instances.

  **Configure remote ClickHouse in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml - Configure your MooseStack project
  
  [project]
  name = "analytics-pipeline"
  language = "typescript"
  
  # Configure remote ClickHouse database connection
  [dev.remote_clickhouse]
  host = "clickhouse.company.com"
  port = 8443
  database = "analytics_db"
  protocol = "http"
  use_ssl = true
  
  # Other configuration sections
  [docker]
  enabled = false  # Disable local Docker when using remote ClickHouse
  
  [kafka]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9092
  ```

  This example shows how to configure a remote ClickHouse database in the moose.config.toml file. When you run `moose dev`, the CLI will securely prompt for and store your database credentials in the OS keychain, enabling your team to connect to hosted ClickHouse instances instead of local Docker containers.

  PR: [#3489](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3489) | Docs: [/moosestack/olap](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/olap)

**Add interactive browsing and web integration to `moose docs`** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  The `moose docs` command now supports interactive browsing with `moose docs browse`, section-level navigation for guides using anchors (e.g., `moose docs guides/chat-in-your-app#overview`), and a `--web` flag to open documentation pages directly in your browser. This makes it easier to explore and navigate the documentation from the command line.

  **Enhanced moose docs with interactive browsing and web support**

  ```bash
  # View the main documentation index
  moose docs
  
  # Browse documentation interactively and select a page
  moose docs browse
  
  # Open a specific page in your browser instead of terminal
  moose docs moosestack/olap --web
  
  # Navigate to a specific section of a guide
  moose docs guides/chat-in-your-app#setup
  
  # Search for documentation pages
  moose docs search "materialized views"
  
  # View Python-specific documentation 
  moose docs --lang py moosestack/data-modeling
  
  # Get raw markdown output for scripting
  moose docs moosestack/olap --raw | grep "CREATE TABLE"
  
  # Interactive browsing with web integration
  moose docs browse --web  # Select page and open in browser
  
  # View expanded documentation tree
  moose docs --expand
  ```

  This example demonstrates the enhanced `moose docs` command with interactive browsing, section-level navigation using anchors, and web integration. Users can now browse docs interactively, jump to specific guide sections, and open documentation directly in their browser from the command line.

  PR: [#3468](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3468) | Docs: [/moosestack/moose-cli](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/moose-cli)

**Add generate dockerfile command for Docker customization** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Added new `moose generate dockerfile` command that creates a customizable Dockerfile without building Docker images. This allows developers to generate and modify the Dockerfile for their deployment needs before running the build process. The command requires `custom_dockerfile = true` in moose.config.toml and places the Dockerfile at the configured path (default: ./Dockerfile).

  **Generate and customize Dockerfile for Moose deployment**

  ```bash
  # First, enable custom dockerfile mode in your moose.config.toml
  cat >> moose.config.toml << EOF
  [docker_config]
  custom_dockerfile = true
  dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
  EOF
  
  # Generate the Dockerfile without building images
  moose generate dockerfile
  
  # Now you can customize the generated Dockerfile
  # Add custom dependencies, caching layers, etc.
  cat >> Dockerfile << EOF
  
  # Add custom dependencies
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\
      curl \\
      jq \\
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  
  # Add custom environment variables
  ENV CUSTOM_CONFIG_PATH=/app/config
  EOF
  
  # Build the Docker image with your customizations
  moose build --docker
  
  # Or build for specific architecture
  moose build --docker --amd64
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new generate dockerfile command to create a customizable Dockerfile for a Moose data pipeline project. The workflow demonstrates enabling custom dockerfile mode, generating the base Dockerfile, customizing it with additional dependencies, and building the final Docker image.

  PR: [#3475](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3475) | Docs: [/moosestack/configuration/docker](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/configuration/docker)

**Custom Dockerfile support for Docker deployments** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Moose now supports custom Dockerfiles for deployment packaging. Enable `custom_dockerfile = true` in moose.config.toml or use the `--custom-dockerfile` flag during project initialization to have Moose generate a Dockerfile in your project root that you can customize. This allows you to add system dependencies, configure caching, or adjust build stages while still using `moose build --docker` to build images.

  **Enable custom Dockerfile in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml
  name = "my-analytics-platform"
  
  [database_config]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 5432
  database = "analytics"
  
  [infrastructure]
  olap = true
  streaming = true
  
  # Enable custom Dockerfile for deployment
  [docker_config]
  custom_dockerfile = true
  dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
  ```

  This example shows how to enable custom Dockerfile support in a Moose project by setting custom_dockerfile = true in moose.config.toml. Once enabled, running 'moose build --docker' will generate a Dockerfile in your project root that you can customize with additional dependencies or build steps.

**Add /llm.txt endpoint for LLM documentation discovery** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  Added a new /llm.txt endpoint that provides plain text versions of documentation for improved LLM consumption. This complements the existing /llm.md endpoint and enables better AI-powered documentation search and assistance. The endpoint supports language-specific filtering and handles both static and dynamic guide content.

  PR: [#3471](https://github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/3471) | Docs: [/guides/chat-in-your-app-usecase-notation](https://docs.moosejs.com/guides/chat-in-your-app-usecase-notation)

**Add optional email to moose feedback command** (Johanan Ottensooser)
  The moose feedback command now supports an optional --email flag to provide your email address for follow-up responses. If no email is provided via the flag, users are interactively prompted to optionally enter one. Email validation is included with retry options for invalid addresses.

  **Using moose feedback with optional email support**

  ```bash
  # Basic feedback without email
  moose feedback "The streaming aggregations are working perfectly!"
  
  # Feedback with email for follow-up
  moose feedback "Would love to see more Python examples in docs" --email developer@company.com
  
  # Interactive feedback (will prompt for optional email)
  moose feedback "Great performance improvements in v0.3!"
  # Output: Your email (optional, press Enter to skip):
  # > user@example.com
  
  # Report a bug with email
  moose feedback "Memory leak in aggregation processing" --bug
  
  # Join the community
  moose feedback --community
  
  # Get help with all feedback options
  moose feedback
  ```

  Demonstrates the enhanced moose feedback command with optional email functionality. Shows how users can provide feedback with or without email addresses, either via the --email flag or interactive prompts, enabling better follow-up on user issues and suggestions.

### Improvements
- Improve deployment reliability by always pulling latest images: Deployments now always pull the latest version of container images tagged with ":latest", ensuring users get the most up-to-date application versions and preventing issues with cached outdated images. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Reduce deployment startup times from 20 minutes to 3.5 minutes: Application deployments now start up significantly faster with reduced startup probe failure thresholds and timeout values. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve deployment performance and multi-tenant isolation: Moose deployments now start faster by preferring pre-warmed nodes when available, and multi-tenant environments get stronger isolation to prevent performance interference between organizations. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Improve deployment availability during system maintenance: Moose deployments now remain available during planned system maintenance and node upgrades through automatic pod disruption management. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Faster deployment startup times with cluster warm pool: Moose deployments now start significantly faster by using pre-warmed nodes that are ready to run applications immediately. (Mitchell Suzuki)
