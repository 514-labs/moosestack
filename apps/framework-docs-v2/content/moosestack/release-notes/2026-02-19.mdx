## 🐻 Boreal

### New Features
**Deploy branches on git push without requiring pull requests** (Mitchell Suzuki)
  Branch deployments can now be triggered by pushing to any branch in your repository, not just through pull request workflows. This streamlines the development workflow by automatically creating preview environments for feature branches as soon as code is pushed, enabling faster iteration and testing of changes before opening a PR.

**New Boreal CLI with setup and link commands for project onboarding** (Lucio Franco)
  Introduced the new Boreal CLI with comprehensive project setup capabilities. The `boreal setup <org>/<project>` command clones projects locally with optional branch creation and deployment setup. The `boreal link` command connects existing local repositories to Boreal projects for streamlined deployment workflows. Both commands support authentication, interactive and non-interactive modes, and provide clear guidance for next steps in the development workflow.

  **Boreal CLI setup and link commands for project onboar
  ```bash
  # Clone and set up a new project from Boreal
  boreal setup acme/analytics-api --path ./my-analytics-app --branch feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd my-analytics-app
  
  # The setup command automatically:
  # - Clones the repository
  # - Creates the specified branch
  # - Links the repo to Boreal project
  # - Sets up deployment configuration
  
  # Make your changes
  echo "console.log('Hello from analytics API');" > src/index.js
  
  # Push changes to trigger deployment
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add initial analytics endpoint"
  git push origin feature/new-dashboard
  
  # Link an existing local repository to a Boreal project
  cd /path/to/existing/repo
  boreal link --project acme/marketing-dashboard --yes
  
  # Or use interactive mode to select from available projects
  boreal link
  ```

  This example shows the complete workflow for using the new Boreal CLI commands to set up new projects and link existing repositories. The setup command handles cloning, branch creation, and deployment configuration, while the link command connects existing local repos to Boreal projects for streamlined deployments.

**Add update command to 514 CLI** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added a new `514 update` command that allows users to update both the 514 and moose CLIs to their latest versions. The CLI now also automatically checks for updates and displays notifications when newer versions are available, helping users stay current with the latest features and fixes.

  **Using the 514 update command to keep CLIs current**

  ```bash
  # Update both 514 and moose CLIs to latest versions
  514 update
  ```

  This example shows how to use the new 514 update command to keep your CLI tools current. The command can update both CLIs together or individually, and includes automatic update notifications to help users stay informed about new versions.

**Start developing feature now available to all users** (groy-514)
  The "Start Developing" feature, which provides guided steps to help users begin development on their MooseStack projects, is now available to all users without experimental flags. This feature appears in deployment details pages and branch management sections, making it easier for users to get started with their projects.

### Improvements
- Faster template deployments using pre-built images: Template-based projects now deploy immediately using pre-built Docker images instead of waiting for the build process to complete, significantly reducing deployment time for new projects. (Mitchell Suzuki)
- Rebrand from Boreal to Fiveonefour Hosting throughout the platform: Updated all user-facing text, logos, and branding elements from "Boreal" to "Fiveonefour Hosting" across the entire platform interface. (groy-514)
- Improve CLI project selection with URLs and IDs: The CLI now accepts project URLs, UUIDs, and bare project names in addition to org/project slug format when selecting projects. (Lucio Franco)
- Streamline organization selection during CLI login: The CLI now automatically prompts users to select an organization after login, and auto-selects when only one organization is available, eliminating the need for separate org switch commands. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve CLI messaging with modern formatting: CLI commands now use cleaner formatting with checkmarks, better error messages, and more helpful guidance for next steps. (Lucio Franco)
- Improve organization switching with visual feedback: Organization switching now shows a loading screen with progress feedback and disables UI interactions during the switch to prevent conflicts. (groy-514)
- Add clarifying note for existing database option: Added a helpful note explaining that existing tables remain unchanged when using an existing ClickHouse database for new projects. (groy-514)
- Improve branch page layout with better text truncation: The branch pages top bar now properly handles long repository names and URLs with improved text truncation and responsive layout. (groy-514)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix logs with identical timestamps and content selecting together: Fixed an issue in the logs viewer where multiple log entries with the same timestamp and content would all be selected when clicking on one. PR: [#3481](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack/pull/3481), [#1405](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack/pull/1405), [#1427](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack/pull/1427) (Lucio Franco)
- Fix mobile website display issues: Fixed display and layout issues on the mobile version of the marketing website, improving user experience on mobile devices. (George Anderson)
- Fix duplicate deployments during template project creation: Fixed an issue where template projects would trigger duplicate deployments due to race conditions between project creation and push webhooks. (Dave Seleno)

## 🦌 Moose

### New Features
**Add lifecycle management support to materialized views** (Dave Seleno)
  Materialized views now support lifecycle management with three options: FULLY_MANAGED (default - Moose manages creation, updates, and deletion), DELETION_PROTECTED (prevents accidental deletion and updates), and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED (user manages the view outside of Moose). This gives users fine-grained control over how their materialized views are managed in production environments.

  **Materialized View Lifecycle Management Options**

  ```typescript
  import { MaterializedView, LifeCycle, Key, DateTime } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
  import { UserActivity } from "../ingest/models";
  
  // Define the aggregated data structure
  interface UserActivitySummary {
    userId: Key<string>;
    totalEvents: number;
    lastActivity: DateTime;
  }
  
  const userActivityTable = UserActivity.table!;
  
  // FULLY_MANAGED (default) - Moose handles everything
  export const userSummaryMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "UserActivitySummary",
    targetTable: {
      name: "UserActivitySummaryTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId", "lastActivity"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT 
        userId,
        count() as totalEvents,
        max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    // lifeCycle defaults to FULLY_MANAGED - Moose creates, updates, and deletes
  });
  
  // DELETION_PROTECTED - Prevents accidental deletion or updates
  export const criticalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "CriticalUserReport", 
    targetTable: {
      name: "CriticalUserReportTable",
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `
      SELECT userId, count() as totalEvents, max(timestamp) as lastActivity
      FROM \`${userActivityTable.name}\`
      WHERE userId IN (SELECT userId FROM premium_users)
      GROUP BY userId
    `,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.DELETION_PROTECTED, // Prevents drops/updates
  });
  
  // EXTERNALLY_MANAGED - User manages the view outside of Moose
  export const externalReportMV = new MaterializedView<UserActivitySummary>({
    materializedViewName: "ExternalUserReport",
    targetTable: {
      name: "ExternalUserReportTable", 
      orderByFields: ["userId"],
    },
    selectStatement: `SELECT userId, 0 as totalEvents, now() as lastActivity FROM users`,
    selectTables: [userActivityTable],
    lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED, // Moose won't create or manage this view
  });
  ```

  This example shows how to use the three lifecycle management options for materialized views: FULLY_MANAGED (default) for automatic management, DELETION_PROTECTED to prevent accidental changes to critical views, and EXTERNALLY_MANAGED for views managed outside of Moose.

**Add comprehensive documentation for externally managed tables** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Added extensive documentation for working with CDC-enabled ClickHouse databases and externally managed tables, including configuration options for local development mirrors, remote connections, and a complete guide for building on existing CDC pipelines like ClickPipes, PeerDB, and Debezium.

  PR: [#3492](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack/pull/3492) | Docs: [/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables](https://docs.moosejs.com/moosestack/dev/cdc-managed-tables)

**Add external table mirroring in dev mode** (Nicolas Joseph)
  Developers can now automatically create local mirror tables for externally managed tables during development. When enabled via `create_local_mirrors = true` in moose.config.toml, the dev server will mirror remote table schemas and optionally sample data to local ClickHouse, making it easier to develop and test with external data sources without requiring direct access to production systems.

  **Enable external table mirroring in moose.config.toml**

  ```toml
  # moose.config.toml
  [project]
  name = "my-analytics-app"
  
  # ClickHouse configuration for local development
  [clickhouse]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9000
  db_name = "analytics_dev"
  
  # Development mode configuration
  [dev.externally_managed.tables]
  # Enable automatic creation of local mirror tables for external tables
  create_local_mirrors = true
  
  # Number of sample rows to copy from remote tables (0 = schema only)
  sample_size = 1000
  
  # Whether to refresh mirrors on startup (drop and recreate)
  refresh_on_startup = true
  
  # Optional: Remote ClickHouse connection for mirroring
  [clickhouse.remote]
  url = "https://production-clickhouse.company.com:8443"
  # username and password stored securely via keyring
  ```

  This configuration enables external table mirroring in development mode. When enabled, the dev server automatically creates local mirror tables for any EXTERNALLY_MANAGED tables, optionally copying sample data from production systems to make local development easier.
