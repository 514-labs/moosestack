# Error Detection and Handling

Moose provides multiple layers of error protection, both at the workflow and task level:

## Workflow-Level Retries and Timeouts

Moose automatically catches any runtime errors during workflow execution. Errors are logged for debugging, and the orchestrator will retry failed tasks according to the `retries` option.

In your `Workflow`, you can configure the following options to control workflow behavior, including timeouts and retries:

<LanguageTabs>
  <LanguageTabContent value="typescript">
```typescript filename="app/index.ts" copy
import { Task, Workflow } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export const myworkflow = new Workflow("myworkflow", {
  startingTask: task1,
  retries: 1,
  timeout: "10m",
});
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
  <LanguageTabContent value="python">
```python filename="app/main.py" copy
from moose_lib import Task, TaskConfig, Workflow, WorkflowConfig

myworkflow = Workflow(
  name="myworkflow",
  config=WorkflowConfig(starting_task=task1, retries=1, timeout="10m")
)
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
</LanguageTabs>

## Task-Level Errors and Retries

For more granular control over task-level errors and retries, you can configure your individual tasks to have their own retry behavior. 
For workflows & tasks that may not have a predefined timeout, you may set `never` as the timeout.

<LanguageTabs>
  <LanguageTabContent value="typescript">
```typescript filename="app/index.ts" copy
import { Task, Workflow } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export const task1 = new Task<Foo, void>("task1", {
  run: async (ctx) => {},
  retries: 1,
  timeout: "5m"
});

export const myworkflow = new Workflow("myworkflow", {
  startingTask: task1,
  retries: 2,
  timeout: "10m",
});
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
  <LanguageTabContent value="python">
```python filename="app/main.py" copy
from moose_lib import Task, TaskConfig, TaskContext, Workflow, WorkflowConfig

def run_task1(ctx: TaskContext[Foo]) -> None:
    pass

task1 = Task[Foo, None](
    name="task1",
    config=TaskConfig(run=run_task1, retries=1, timeout="5m")
)

myworkflow = Workflow(
  name="myworkflow",
  config=WorkflowConfig(starting_task=task1, retries=2, timeout="10m")
)
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
</LanguageTabs>

## Example: Workflow and Task Retry Interplay

When configuring retries, it's important to understand how workflow-level and task-level retries interact. Consider the following scenario:

<LanguageTabs>
  <LanguageTabContent value="typescript">
- **Workflow Retry Policy**: 2 attempts
- **Task Retry Policy**: 3 attempts

```typescript filename="app/index.ts" copy
import { Task, Workflow } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export const task1 = new Task<Foo, void>("task1", {
  run: async (ctx) => {},
  retries: 3,
});

export const myworkflow = new Workflow("myworkflow", {
  startingTask: task1,
  retries: 2,
});
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
  <LanguageTabContent value="python">
```python filename="app/main.py" copy
from moose_lib import Task, TaskConfig, TaskContext, Workflow, WorkflowConfig

def run_task1(ctx: TaskContext[Foo]) -> None:
    pass

task1 = Task[Foo, None](
    name="task1",
    config=TaskConfig(run=run_task1, retries=2)
)

myworkflow = Workflow(
  name="myworkflow",
  config=WorkflowConfig(starting_task=task1, retries=3)
)
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
</LanguageTabs>

If the execution of the workflow encounters an error, the retry sequence would proceed as follows:

1. **Workflow Attempt 1**
   - **Task Attempt 1**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 2**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 3**: Task fails
   - Workflow attempt fails after exhausting task retries

2. **Workflow Attempt 2**
   - **Task Attempt 1**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 2**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 3**: Task fails
   - Workflow attempt fails after exhausting task retries

In this example, the workflow will make a total of 2 attempts, and each task within those attempts will retry up to 3 times before the workflow itself retries.
