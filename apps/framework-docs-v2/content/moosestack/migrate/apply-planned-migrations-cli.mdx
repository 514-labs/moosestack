# moose migrate

The **CLI** deployment model relies on the `moose migrate` CLI command to execute planned schema changes. This gives you explicit control over when migrations run, which is essential for architectures where Moose OLAP is integrated as a library rather than a standalone server (e.g. as a library in a Python or TypeScript application).

## Overview

In serverless or library-based deployments, MooseStack does not control the application runtime. Therefore, migrations must be triggered externally, typically as a step in a CI/CD pipeline or a manual administrative action.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Control** | Migrations run only when you explicitly execute the command. |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Designed to run as a discrete step in deployment pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions). |
| **Drift Protection** | Validates `remote_state.json` against the target database before execution. |
| **Direct Connection** | Connects directly to ClickHouse using a connection string. |

## Command Reference

```bash
moose migrate --clickhouse-url <CONNECTION_STRING>
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--clickhouse-url` | The full connection string to the target ClickHouse database (e.g., `clickhouse://user:pass@host:9440/db`). | Yes |

## Execution Lifecycle

When `moose migrate` is executed:

1.  **Load Plan:** Reads `migrations/plan.yaml` from the current directory.
2.  **Check Database Drift:** Connects to the provided ClickHouse URL and compares the current schema against `remote_state.json`.
3.  **Abort on Drift:** If the database state does not match the snapshot, the process exits with an error code.
4.  **Execute Migration:** Applies the operations defined in `plan.yaml` sequentially.
5.  **Report Success:** Exits with code 0 if all operations succeed.

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Outcome | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drift Detected** | Command fails (exit code 1). | Regenerate the plan against the current production DB and retry. |
| **Connection Error** | Command fails (exit code 1). | Check network connectivity and credentials in the connection string. |
| **SQL Error** | Command fails (exit code 1). | Fix the problematic operation in `plan.yaml` or the database state and retry. |

## CI/CD Example

This command is typically used in a deployment pipeline before updating the application code.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Apply Migrations
  run: moose migrate --clickhouse-url "$CLICKHOUSE_URL"
        env:
    CLICKHOUSE_URL: ${{ secrets.CLICKHOUSE_URL }}
```
