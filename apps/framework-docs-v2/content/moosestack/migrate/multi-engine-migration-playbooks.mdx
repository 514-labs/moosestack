# Multi-Engine Migration Playbooks

Use these playbooks to sequence adoption with the lowest risk.

## Playbook 1: Stay ClickHouse-First (No Changes Required)

**Best for:** teams that need stability now.

Current path:

1. Continue existing `clickhouse_config`-based workflows.
2. Keep using `moose generate migration --clickhouse-url ...` and `moose migrate --clickhouse-url ...`.
3. Optionally use lifecycle controls to reduce migration risk in production.

## Playbook 2: Adopt Remote-First Cloud Development

**Best for:** teams standardizing on ClickHouse Cloud + Redpanda Cloud.

Current path:

1. Configure cloud env vars for ClickHouse and Redpanda.
2. Run local runtime with `moose dev --no-infra`.
3. Keep migration workflow explicit with existing `--clickhouse-url` flags.

## Playbook 3: Prepare for DuckDB + MotherDuck

**Best for:** teams that want lightweight local iteration and optional managed expansion.

Planned path (RFC-defined):

1. Move toward engine-neutral contract surfaces.
2. Use common-core modeling where possible.
3. Keep engine-specific features isolated behind explicit extension usage.

## Playbook 4: Prepare for Snowflake Remote-First

**Best for:** teams whose production OLAP target is Snowflake.

Planned path (RFC-defined):

1. Treat Snowflake as remote-first from day one.
2. Adopt deterministic branch isolation policy (schema/database/account strategy).
3. Validate capability-mismatch diagnostics before rollout.

<Callout type="warning" title="Current vs Planned">
This page includes both available workflows and RFC-defined planned workflows. Planned workflows are not runtime-implemented in this release.

## Decision Checklist Before Migration

1. Which dev profile do we need now (`local` vs remote-first)?
2. Which features must remain portable across engines?
3. Which engine-specific features are acceptable and explicit?
4. What is our backward compatibility window for legacy flags/config?
