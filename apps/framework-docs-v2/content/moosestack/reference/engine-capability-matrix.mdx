# Engine Capability Matrix

This matrix defines the user-facing experience contract for engine support.

## Status Legend

- **Current**: available now
- **Planned**: defined in RFC, not yet implemented
- **Out of scope (this cycle)**: intentionally excluded from first-wave experience

## Core Capability Matrix

| Capability | ClickHouse | DuckDB | Snowflake |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engine selection in project contract | Current (engine-specific) | Planned | Planned |
| Common-core table modeling | Current | Planned | Planned |
| View/materialized-view common-core contract | Current | Planned | Planned |
| Engine-specific extensions surfaced explicitly | Current | Planned | Planned |
| Remote-first developer workflow | Current (`--no-infra` path) | Planned | Planned (remote-first) |
| Local native engine development | Current | Planned | Out of scope |
| Cloud branch-isolation strategy | Partial (manual conventions) | Planned (MotherDuck conventions) | Planned |

## Non-Portable Features (Explicit by Design)

| Feature Area | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| ClickHouse-specific table engines | Remain engine-specific |
| Snowflake warehouse/account semantics | Remain engine-specific |
| DuckDB/MotherDuck deployment modes | Remain engine-specific |

<Callout type="info" title="Compatibility Strategy">
MooseStack uses a common-core-first model: portable defaults first, engine-specific extensions explicitly declared.
</Callout>

## Remote-First Cloud Matrix

| Remote-First Area | ClickHouse Cloud | Redpanda Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credentials via env vars | Current | Current |
| Validation during local runtime start | Partial (manual + existing command checks) | Partial (manual + existing command checks) |
| Profile-native preflight UX | Planned | Planned |
| Branch/namespace lifecycle guidance | Planned | Planned |
