# Language Server for Moose Development

The MooseStack Language Server provides real-time SQL intelligence for `sql` tagged template literals in TypeScript Moose projects. It gives you syntax validation, auto-completions, hover documentation, and code formatting as you write SQL in your editor.

<Callout type="info">
The Language Server currently supports TypeScript projects only.
</Callout>

## Features

- **Error diagnostics** - Instant feedback on SQL syntax errors
- **Auto-complete** - ClickHouse functions, keywords, data types, table engines, and more
- **Hover documentation** - Syntax help and examples for ClickHouse functions
- **Code actions** - Format SQL directly from your editor

## Installation

Install the Language Server globally:

```bash
npm install -g @514labs/moose-lsp
```

For VS Code or Cursor, search for "MooseStack LSP" in the Extensions panel and click Install.
