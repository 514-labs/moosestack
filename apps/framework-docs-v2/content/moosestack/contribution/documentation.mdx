# Contributing to Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MooseStack documentation! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

The documentation is built using MDX files located in the `content/` directory. Each section corresponds to a folder structure that matches the navigation.

## Making Changes

1. **Find the relevant file** - Navigate to the appropriate folder in `content/`
2. **Edit the MDX file** - Make your changes using standard Markdown and MDX syntax
3. **Test locally** - Run the documentation site locally to verify your changes
4. **Submit a PR** - Create a pull request with your improvements

## Documentation Structure

- All content files are in the `content/` directory
- Each MDX file has frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `order`, and `category`
- Code examples should be language-agnostic when possible, or clearly marked for TypeScript or Python

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Link to related documentation
- Keep formatting consistent with existing pages

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
