# Contributing to the Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MooseStack framework! This guide covers how to contribute to the core framework codebase.

## Getting Started

The MooseStack framework is a monorepo containing:
- Rust CLI components
- TypeScript library (`ts-moose-lib`)
- Python library (`py-moose-lib`)
- Protocol buffer definitions

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies** - Use `pnpm install` for JS/TS packages and `cargo build` for Rust
3. **Run tests** - Ensure all tests pass before making changes
4. **Make your changes** - Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Code Standards

### Rust
- Must pass `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Use `thiserror` for error definitions
- Follow existing patterns for error handling

### TypeScript
- Must pass linting checks
- Follow existing type patterns
- Keep API compatibility in mind when making breaking changes

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Ensure type hints are included
- Run tests with `pytest`

## Submitting Changes

1. **Create a branch** - Branch from the main development branch
2. **Make your changes** - Ensure all tests pass
3. **Submit a PR** - Include a clear description of changes
