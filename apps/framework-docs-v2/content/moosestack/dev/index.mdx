# Moose Dev

The `moose dev` command starts a local development environment with hot-reload, containerized infrastructure (ClickHouse, Redpanda, Temporal, Redis), and automatic schema synchronization.

## What Happens When You Run `moose dev`

1. **Infrastructure starts** - Docker containers spin up for ClickHouse, Redpanda, Redis, and Temporal
2. **Code compiles** - Your data models, streams, and functions are compiled and validated
3. **Schema syncs** - Tables, views, and topics are created/updated in local infrastructure
4. **Server starts** - The Moose runtime serves your APIs and processes data
5. **File watcher activates** - Changes to your code trigger automatic reloads

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Hot Reload** | Code changes are detected and applied without restarting |
| **Local Infrastructure** | Full ClickHouse, Redpanda, Redis, and Temporal stack |
| **Schema Sync** | Tables and topics are created/updated automatically |
| **External Table Mirroring** | Optionally mirror remote tables for local development |
