# Engine Guides

Start with the common contract, then use these guides for engine-specific behavior.

## Choose a guide

- [ClickHouse](/moosestack/olap) for high-throughput analytics and table engine tuning.
- [DuckDB](/moosestack/engines/duckdb) for local analytics and MotherDuck expansion.
- [Snowflake](/moosestack/engines/snowflake) for remote-first enterprise warehouse workflows.

## Common contract for all engines

```toml
[olap]
engine = "clickhouse" # clickhouse | duckdb | snowflake
profile = "remote"    # local | remote
connection = "..."

[dev_infra]
profile = "local"     # local | remote_hybrid | remote_full
```
