# DuckDB

DuckDB is the fastest way to iterate locally. It keeps setup small and feedback fast.

## Recommended profile

```toml
[olap]
engine = "duckdb"
profile = "local"
connection = "duckdb:///./.moose/dev.duckdb"

[dev_infra]
profile = "local"
```

## Typical commands

```bash
moose dev --infra-profile local
moose plan --olap-engine duckdb --olap-url "duckdb:///./.moose/dev.duckdb"
moose generate migration --olap-engine duckdb --olap-url "duckdb:///./.moose/dev.duckdb" --save
moose migrate --olap-engine duckdb --olap-url "duckdb:///./.moose/dev.duckdb"
```

## MotherDuck path

When your team needs managed remote execution:

1. Keep the same models.
2. Update `olap.connection` to your MotherDuck connection.
3. Keep `--olap-engine duckdb` in CI and deploy commands.

## Known differences

- DuckDB focuses on local file-backed workflows.
- Some engine-specific tuning differs from ClickHouse and Snowflake.
- Use the capability matrix for portability checks.
