## Troubleshooting

<ToggleBlock title="Services won't start">
Make sure Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient resources allocated:

```bash
docker ps  # Check running containers
moose logs # View Moose service logs
```
</ToggleBlock>

<ToggleBlock title="Port conflicts">
If you see port binding errors, check for conflicting services:

```bash
lsof -i :4000  # Check what's using the port
```

You can change default ports in your `.moose` configuration.
</ToggleBlock>

<ToggleBlock title="Build errors">
Try cleaning your build cache and reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .moose
npm install
moose build
```
</ToggleBlock>
