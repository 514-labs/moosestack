### Deploy to Fiveonefour hosting and Vercel

We'll prepare the application for deployment by setting up authentication, then deploy the MooseStack application to Fiveonefour hosting, and the web-app to Vercel. You can set up authentication and hosting to your preferences, if we haven't covered your preferred option in our docs, reach out in our slack community: [https://slack.moosestack.com/](https://slack.moosestack.com/). 

Authentication was covered in the start of this guide, but covers back end to front end authentication only (you should also add authentication to restrict access to your frontend).

#### Deploy MooseStack to Fiveonefour hosting

[Go to Fiveonefour hosting and set up an account](https://www.boreal.cloud/sign-up). Link your GitHub account. Create an organization. Create a new project:

Select import a MooseStack Project:

Set the path to the root of the MooseStack service:

```text
packages/moosestack-service
```

And set the Environment Variables used in the project ([following the same steps defined above](#create-and-configure-.env-files:)):

```text
MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY
MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY
MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN
MOOSE_WEB_APP_API_KEYS
```

Continue, selecting Fiveonefour hosting defaults (or point it at your own managed ClickHouse and Redpanda instances if you like).

Click Deploy, and you'll see your application MooseStack being deployed.

#### Deploy your Next.js frontend to Vercel

<Callout type="warning" title="Authentication">
The authentication set up above just ensures your backend and frontend can communicate securely. You still need to add authentication to your frontend to restrict access to your data.

Vercel offers this natively for preview deployments. For production, consider [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), or [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

See Vercel docs:
- [Vercel authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication)
- [Third party auth](https://vercel.com/guides/application-authentication-on-vercel)
</Callout>

##### Deployment

1. From the Vercel home-page, add a new project.  
2. Point it at this project, and set the root directory to packages/web-app  
3. Set the following environment variables

```text
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your Anthropic API key for chat functionality
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Your Fiveonefour hosting endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-project.boreal.cloud`)
API_KEY: Use the bearer token generated earlier
```

You can find your Fiveonefour hosting endpoint URL at the top of the project overview page:
