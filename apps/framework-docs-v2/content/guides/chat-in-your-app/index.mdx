# Building a data-aware chat on top of your ClickHouse database with Next.js and MooseStack

<Callout type="info" title="TL;DR">

1. Help define when and how to prototype in app chat and get it used
2. Help you improve your chat with rich context, and connect rich sources to your chat
3. Help you embed chat into your existing Next.js application
