# Data as Code

This guide covers how to implement data as code practices using MooseStack's code-first approach.

## Overview

Data as code means treating your data infrastructure the same way you treat application code—version controlled, tested, and deployed through CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Concepts

- Version-controlled schemas
- Automated testing
- CI/CD integration
- Infrastructure as code

## Next Steps
