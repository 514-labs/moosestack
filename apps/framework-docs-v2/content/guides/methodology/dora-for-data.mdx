# DORA for Data

This guide shows you how to implement DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics for data engineering teams.

## Overview

DORA metrics help measure and improve the performance of data engineering teams by tracking deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and time to restore service.

## Key Concepts

- Deployment frequency tracking
- Lead time measurement
- Change failure rate monitoring
- Recovery time analysis

## Next Steps
