# Step 2: Create Materialized View

In this step, you'll create materialized views that pre-aggregate data from your OLTP database for fast dashboard queries.

## Overview

Materialized views store pre-computed query results, allowing dashboards to load instantly without querying your production OLTP database directly. This step shows you how to define and create these views.

## Define Materialized View

<LanguageTabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <LanguageTabContent value="typescript">
```typescript filename="dashboard-views.ts"
import { OlapMaterializedView, OlapTable } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

// Define the source table (from your OLTP DB)
interface OrdersTable {
  id: string;
  customer_id: string;
  amount: number;
  created_at: Date;
}

// Define the materialized view
interface DailySalesView {
  date: Date;
  total_sales: number;
  order_count: number;
}

export const dailySalesView = new OlapMaterializedView<DailySalesView>(
  "daily_sales",
  {
    source: "orders", // References your OLTP table
    query: `
      SELECT
        toDate(created_at) as date,
        sum(amount) as total_sales,
        count(*) as order_count
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY date
    `,
    refresh: "incremental", // Update as new data arrives
  }
);
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
  <LanguageTabContent value="python">
```python filename="dashboard_views.py"
from moose_lib import OlapMaterializedView
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import date

# Define the materialized view
class DailySalesView(BaseModel):
    date: date
    total_sales: float
    order_count: int

daily_sales_view = OlapMaterializedView[DailySalesView](
    "daily_sales",
    source="orders",
    query="""
        SELECT
            toDate(created_at) as date,
            sum(amount) as total_sales,
            count(*) as order_count
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY date
    """,
    refresh="incremental",
)
```
  </LanguageTabContent>
</LanguageTabs>

## Apply the View

Create the materialized view in your database:

```bash
moose db migrate
```

## Query the View

Once created, you can query the materialized view directly:

```typescript
const results = await dailySalesView.select({
  date: { $gte: new Date("2024-01-01") },
});
```

## Next Steps

Your materialized view is now ready! You can use it in your dashboard queries for fast, pre-aggregated data.
