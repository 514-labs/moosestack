# Step 1: Setup Connection

In this step, you'll configure MooseStack to connect to your existing OLTP database.

## Overview

MooseStack needs to connect to your existing database to read data and create materialized views. This connection is configured securely and doesn't require any changes to your production database.

## Configuration

### TypeScript

```typescript filename="moose.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@514labs/moose-cli";

export default defineConfig({
  dataSources: {
    postgres: {
      type: "postgres",
      host: process.env.DB_HOST || "localhost",
      port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || "5432"),
      database: process.env.DB_NAME || "mydb",
      user: process.env.DB_USER || "postgres",
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || "",
    },
  },
});
```

### Python

```python filename="moose.config.py"
from moose_cli import define_config

config = define_config(
    data_sources={
        "postgres": {
            "type": "postgres",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 5432,
            "database": "mydb",
            "user": "postgres",
            "password": "",
        }
    }
)
```

## Environment Variables

For security, store sensitive credentials in environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your-database
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Verify Connection

After configuring the connection, verify it works:

```bash
moose db ping
```

## Next Steps

Once your connection is configured, proceed to the next step to create materialized views.
