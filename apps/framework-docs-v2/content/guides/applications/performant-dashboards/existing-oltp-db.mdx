# From Existing OLTP DB

This guide walks you through building performant dashboards by connecting to your existing OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database and creating optimized materialized views for analytics.

## Overview

When you have an existing OLTP database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server), you can leverage MooseStack to create high-performance dashboards without disrupting your production database. This approach involves:

1. **Connecting** to your existing database
2. **Creating materialized views** that aggregate and pre-compute data
3. **Querying** the materialized views for fast dashboard responses

## Benefits

- **No disruption** to your production OLTP database
- **Fast queries** through pre-aggregated materialized views
- **Real-time updates** as data changes in your source database
- **Scalable** architecture that separates transactional and analytical workloads

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Access to your existing OLTP database
- Database connection credentials
- A MooseStack project initialized

## Implementation Steps

Follow the steps below to implement performant dashboards from your existing OLTP database. Each step builds on the previous one, guiding you through the complete setup process.
