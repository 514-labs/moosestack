# Improving the Performance of Your Dashboards

<Callout type="info" title="TL;DR">
* Slow dashboards are usually a database architecture problem, not a frontend or charting library problem.
* Running analytical queries on your transactional database degrades your entire application's performance and reliability.
* Moving these analytical queries to ClickHouse yields 10–100x faster dashboards

This guide will:

1. Help you recognize when OLTP has become your analytics bottleneck
2. Show an incremental path to move analytical workloads to OLAP
3. Walk through shipping the change end-to-end with MooseStack + ClickHouse
