# Content Components Demo Guide

This guide demonstrates the content component system for documentation. It shows how to reuse content across multiple pages using the `:::include` directive.

<Callout type="info" title="About This Guide">
This is a test guide to demonstrate the content component system. All the sections below are pulled from reusable components in `/content/shared/examples/`.
</Callout>

## Example 1: Simple Include

Let's start with a simple example that includes a single component:

:::include /shared/examples/setup-example.mdx

## Example 2: Another Simple Include

Here's another standalone component:

:::include /shared/examples/code-snippet-example.mdx

## Example 3: Combined Components

This next example is itself a component that includes other components (2-level nesting):

:::include /shared/examples/combined-example.mdx

## Example 4: Deep Nesting (3 Levels)

Now let's demonstrate the maximum nesting depth. This component includes another component, which includes yet another component:

:::include /shared/examples/level-1-component.mdx

## Example 5: Using Prerequisites

You can also include practical prerequisites. Here's how to install Moose:

:::include /shared/prerequisites/install-moose.mdx

## How to Create Your Own

To create your own content components:

1. Create a `.mdx` file in `/content/shared/` (under `prerequisites/` or `examples/`)
2. Write your content using any MDX components
3. Use `:::include /shared/path/to/your-component.mdx` in any guide

## Next Steps

Try creating your own content components! Common use cases:

- Installation instructions that appear in multiple guides
- Example code patterns that can be reused
- Prerequisite checks shared across guides
