# Force all dependencies to be hoisted locally to this app's node_modules
# This prevents TypeScript from finding React types in nested node_modules
# This overrides the root .npmrc which prevents hoisting to support multiple React versions
# Since this app only uses React 19, we can safely hoist everything here
