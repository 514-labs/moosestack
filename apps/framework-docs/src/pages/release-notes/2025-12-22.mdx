### New Features
- **Release notes for December 15, 2025**
  Published comprehensive release notes documenting new features, improvements, and bug fixes including ClickHouse connection info display, new table engine support, JSON output for CLI commands, and various database reliability fixes across Moose, Boreal, and infrastructure components.

- **Add support for column comments in data models**
  Data model fields now support comments/descriptions that are preserved in the generated ClickHouse database schema. In TypeScript, use TSDoc comments (/** */), and in Python, use Field(description="..."). These comments appear as COMMENT clauses in the database DDL, making schemas more self-documenting and easier to understand for data analysts and other team members.

  **Adding column comments with TSDoc in data models**
  ```typescript
  // models/UserEvent.ts
  export interface UserEvent {
    /** Unique identifier for the record */
    id: string;
    
    /** Timestamp when the event occurred */
    timestamp: Date;
    
    /** Email address of the user (must be valid) */
    email: string;
    
    /** Total price in USD ($) */
    price: number;
    
    // No comment - this field won't have a database comment
    status: string;
  }
  
  // models/OrderStatus.ts
  export enum OrderStatus {
    Pending = "pending",
    Processing = "processing", 
    Shipped = "shipped",
    Delivered = "delivered",
    Cancelled = "cancelled"
  }
  
  export interface Order {
    id: string;
    
    /** Current status of the order - updates as order progresses */
    status: OrderStatus;
    
    /** Priority level for fulfillment */
    priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  }
  ```
  
  This example shows how to add column comments to data models using TSDoc comments (/** */). The comments are automatically preserved in the generated ClickHouse database schema as COMMENT clauses, making the database self-documenting for analysts and team members.

- **Add custom Dockerfile support for project initialization**
  Users can now generate a custom Dockerfile at their project root using the new --custom-dockerfile flag with moose init. This allows developers to customize their Docker build process while still leveraging Moose's base configuration. The custom Dockerfile is preserved across builds to maintain user customizations.

  **Initialize Moose project with custom Dockerfile**
  ```bash
  # Initialize a new Moose project with custom Dockerfile support
  moose init my-analytics-pipeline --language typescript --custom-dockerfile
  
  # This creates a project structure like:
  # my-analytics-pipeline/
  # ├── Dockerfile              # Custom Dockerfile at project root
  # ├── moose.config.toml        # Project configuration
  # ├── project.toml            # Project metadata
  # ├── app/                    # Your data models and flows
  # └── .moose/                 # Internal Moose files
  
  # The generated Dockerfile can be customized for your needs:
  # - Add custom dependencies
  # - Configure environment variables
  # - Set up additional services
  # - Modify build steps
  
  # Build your project with the custom Dockerfile
  moose build
  
  # The custom Dockerfile is preserved across builds, so your
  # customizations won't be overwritten by future Moose updates
  ```
  
  Shows how to initialize a new Moose project with custom Dockerfile support using the --custom-dockerfile flag. The generated Dockerfile can be customized for specific deployment needs while still leveraging Moose's base configuration.

- **Added comprehensive data types and engines documentation**
  Added detailed documentation for all ClickHouse data types (arrays, booleans, decimals, datetime, strings, etc.) and table engines (MergeTree variants, distributed engines, S3 integrations). Users can now reference complete type mapping guides and engine configuration examples when building data models.

- **Display ClickHouse connection info during moose dev startup**
  The moose dev command now displays ClickHouse connection URLs when starting local infrastructure, making it easier for developers to connect to their databases for debugging and data exploration. Connection details are shown with masked passwords for security.

- **Add comprehensive December 5, 2025 release notes**
  Published detailed release notes covering major new features including Kafka engine support, IcebergS3 integration, materialized columns, Fastify web app template, and Boreal database storage visualization. Includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and breaking changes that users need to know about.

### Improvements
- Improved Python project loading error messages with diagnostic information: Enhanced error messages when Python projects fail to load, providing detailed diagnostic information including specific file paths, common causes, and step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. Users now get clearer feedback when setup.py is missing, contains syntax errors, or lacks required setup() function calls, making it easier to debug and fix Python project configuration issues.
- Improved documentation code block behavior and disabled AI section by default: Updated documentation site to make code block animations opt-in rather than automatic, providing a cleaner reading experience. Code blocks now remain static by default and only animate when explicitly requested with the 'animate' attribute. Also disabled the AI section by default in the documentation navigation.
- Improved stream configuration documentation with clearer examples: Enhanced the stream configuration documentation by separating parallelism and retention period into distinct sections with clearer explanations. Added better context about performance trade-offs for parallelism and storage implications for retention periods, making it easier for users to configure streams appropriately.
- Improved data modeling documentation structure: Reorganized the data modeling documentation by promoting "Problem" and "Solution" sections to top-level headings, making it easier for users to understand the core concepts and benefits of Moose's data modeling approach.
- Improved migration documentation with comprehensive guides and troubleshooting: Added extensive documentation for Moose's migration system, including detailed guides for CLI migrations, automatic migrations, planned migrations, and troubleshooting failed migrations. This helps users better understand and manage database schema changes in their data pipelines.

### Bug Fixes
- Fix pnpm build requirements for Kafka JavaScript dependencies: Fixed build issues with pnpm by adding @514labs/kafka-javascript to the onlyBuiltDependencies list across all project templates. This ensures that Kafka-related dependencies are properly built during installation, preventing runtime errors when using streaming features.
- Fix process restart behavior when workflows exit cleanly: Fixed an issue where workflow processes would unnecessarily restart even when they exited cleanly (with exit code 0). Now processes only restart on failures, improving stability and reducing resource usage. Also improved warning messages when no workflows are found to guide users on disabling workflow infrastructure.
- Fix enum comparison to handle different member ordering: Fixed a bug where enum schema comparisons would fail when enum members were defined in different orders between TypeScript models and ClickHouse tables. This ensures that schema migrations and validations work correctly regardless of how enum members are ordered in the source code versus the database.
- Fix Docker builds to respect inject-workspace-dependencies setting: Fixed an issue where Docker builds for TypeScript projects in pnpm workspaces would ignore the inject-workspace-dependencies setting in .npmrc files. This could cause builds to fail or produce inconsistent results when workspace dependencies weren't properly injected. The CLI now detects the workspace configuration and uses the appropriate pnpm deploy mode, with helpful warnings when legacy mode is required.
- Fix Python code generation for Buffer and Distributed engines: Fixed a bug where Python code generation was missing imports for BufferEngine and DistributedEngine, causing errors when users tried to use these ClickHouse table engines in their data models. Users can now properly use Buffer and Distributed engines in their Python data model definitions.
- Fix visual bugs in framework documentation: Fixed various visual bugs and layout issues in the MooseStack framework documentation site, improving readability and user experience when browsing guides and examples.
- Fix prompts for externally managed tables to reference Boreal instead of ClickHouse Cloud: Updated CLI prompts and help text to reference Boreal (boreal.cloud) instead of ClickHouse Cloud when configuring externally managed tables. Also clarified the command to use 'moose db pull' instead of 'moose pull' and updated the setup requirements to be more specific about ClickHouse connection details needed.

### New Features
- **Added infrastructure map visualization to project overview**
  Users can now view an interactive infrastructure map on the project overview page that visualizes their data pipeline components and connections. This feature is currently available as an experimental feature and provides a visual representation of tables, views, APIs, workflows, and other infrastructure components in their MooseStack application.

### Improvements
- Improved ClickHouse query monitoring to include INSERT statements: The log drain system now captures and monitors INSERT statements in addition to SELECT queries, providing more comprehensive database activity visibility. Query filtering has been improved to exclude DDL operations (CREATE, DROP, ALTER) while including data manipulation queries. This gives users better insights into their database performance and usage patterns.

### Bug Fixes
- Fix project deployment for repositories with non-main default branches: Fixed an issue where project deployment would fail for GitHub repositories that use a default branch other than 'main' (such as 'master', 'develop', etc.). Projects can now be successfully deployed regardless of the repository's default branch configuration.
