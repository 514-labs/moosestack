<Callout type="info" title="Highlights">
* **Sloan users** can now use Sloan MCP with VS Code, bringing CLI based MCP configuration to VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop.
</Callout>

## Sloan

### VS Code Support

If you want to add Sloan MCP to your existing Moose project in VS Code, try
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan setup --mcp vscode-project
```

See the [VS Code setup guide](/sloan/getting-started/vs-code) for more details.

### Removal of `read_file` tool
We originally created the `read_file` tool to allow non-code-editor clients to write and read files. From our work with users, we have seen that when people are creating and editing code, they are using code editors, and they primarily use chat based clients for consumption.

### Changing standard tools for each client
Accordingly, Claude-Desktop now defaults to read tools, and code editors now default to read and write tools.
