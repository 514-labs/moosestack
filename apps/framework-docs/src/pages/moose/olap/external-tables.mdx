# External Tables

<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview

External tables allow you to connect Moose to database tables that are managed outside of your application. This is essential when working with:

- **CDC (Change Data Capture) services** like ClickPipes, Debezium, or AWS DMS
- **Legacy database tables** managed by other teams
- **Third-party data sources** with controlled schema evolution

  ]}

## Configuration

<TypeScript>
Set `lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` to tell Moose not to modify the table schema:


```ts filename="ExternalTableExample.ts" copy
import { OlapTable, LifeCycle } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface CdcUserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  updated_at: Date;
}

// Connect to CDC-managed table
const cdcUserTable = new OlapTable<CdcUserData>("cdc_users", {
  lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED
});
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
Set `life_cycle=LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` to tell Moose not to modify the table schema:

```py filename="ExternalTableExample.py" copy
from moose_lib import OlapTable, OlapConfig, LifeCycle
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class CdcUserData(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str
    updated_at: datetime

# Connect to CDC-managed table
cdc_user_table = OlapTable[CdcUserData]("cdc_users", OlapConfig(
    life_cycle=LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED
))
```
</Python>

## Getting Models for External Tables

### New project: initialize from your existing ClickHouse

If you donâ€™t yet have a Moose project, use init-from-remote to bootstrap models from your existing ClickHouse:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose init my-project --from-remote <YOUR_CLICKHOUSE_URL> --language <typescript|python>
```

What happens:

- Moose introspects your database and generates table models in your project.
- If Moose detects ClickPipes (or other CDC-managed) tables, it marks those as `EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` and writes them into a dedicated external models file:
  - TypeScript: `app/externalModels.ts`
  - Python: `app/external_models.py`
- This is a best-effort detection to separate CDC-managed tables from those you may want Moose to manage in code.


How detection works (ClickPipes/PeerDB example):

- Moose looks for PeerDB-specific fields that indicate CDC ownership and versions, such as `_peerdb_synced_at`, `_peerdb_is_deleted`, `_peerdb_version`, and related metadata columns.
- When these are present, the table will be marked `EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` and emitted into the external models file automatically.

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="externalModels.ts" copy
import { OlapTable, LifeCycle, ClickHouseEngines } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
import type { ClickHouseInt, ClickHouseDecimal, ClickHousePrecision, ClickHouseDefault } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
import typia from "typia";

export interface foo {
  id: string & typia.tags.Format<"uuid">;
  name: string;
  description: string | undefined;
  status: string;
  priority: number & ClickHouseInt<"int32">;
  is_active: boolean;
  metadata: string | undefined;
  tags: string[];
  score: (string & ClickHouseDecimal<10, 2>) | undefined;
  large_text: string | undefined;
  created_at: string & typia.tags.Format<"date-time"> & ClickHousePrecision<6>;
  updated_at: string & typia.tags.Format<"date-time"> & ClickHousePrecision<6>;
  _peerdb_synced_at: string & typia.tags.Format<"date-time"> & ClickHousePrecision<9> & ClickHouseDefault<"now64()">;
  _peerdb_is_deleted: number & ClickHouseInt<"int8">;
  _peerdb_version: number & ClickHouseInt<"int64">;
}

export const FooTable = new OlapTable<foo>("foo", {
  orderByFields: ["id"],
  engine: ClickHouseEngines.ReplacingMergeTree,
  ver: "_peerdb_version",
  settings: { index_granularity: "8192" },
  lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED,
});
```
</TypeScript>

### Existing project: mark additional external tables

If there are other tables in your DB that are not CDC-managed but you want Moose to treat as external (not managed by code):

1) Mark them as external in code

<TypeScript>
```ts copy
// In a file you control (not the external file yet)
const table = new OlapTable<MySchema>("my_table", {
  lifeCycle: LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED
});
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```py copy
table = OlapTable[MySchema](
  "my_table",
  OlapConfig(
    life_cycle=LifeCycle.EXTERNALLY_MANAGED
  )
)
```
</Python>

2) Move them into the external models file

- Move the model definitions to your external file (`app/externalModels.ts` or `app/external_models.py`).
- Ensure your root file still loads only the external models via a single import:
  - Add <TypeScript inline>`import "./externalModels";`</TypeScript><Python inline>`from external_models import *`</Python> in your <TypeScript inline>`app/index.ts`</TypeScript><Python inline>`app/main.py`</Python> file.

This keeps truly external tables out of your managed code path, while still making them available locally (and in tooling) without generating production DDL.

## Important Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Do not edit external data models">
`EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` tables reflect schemas owned by your CDC/DBA/ETL processes. Do not change their field shapes in code.

If you accidentally edited an external model, revert to the source of truth by running **DB Pull**: [/moose/olap/db-pull](/moose/olap/db-pull).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Local vs production behavior">
Locally, externally managed tables are created/kept in sync in your development ClickHouse so you can develop against them and **seed data**. See **Seed (ClickHouse)** in the CLI: [/moose/moose-cli#seed-clickhouse](/moose/moose-cli#seed-clickhouse).

Moose will **not** apply schema changes to `EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` tables in production. If you edit these table models in code, those edits will not produce DDL operations in the migration plan (they will not appear in `plan.yaml`).

For more on how migration plans are generated and what shows up in `plan.yaml`, see [/moose/olap/planned-migrations](/moose/olap/planned-migrations).
</Callout>

## Staying in sync with remote schema

For `EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` tables, keep your code in sync with the live database by running DB Pull. You can do it manually or automate it in dev.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose db pull --connection-string <YOUR_CLICKHOUSE_URL>
```

<Callout type="info" title="Keep external models fresh" ctaLink="/moose/olap/db-pull">
Use DB Pull to regenerate your external models file from the remote schema. To run it automatically during development, see the script hooks in [the local development guide](/moose/local-dev#script-execution-hooks).
</Callout>
