# LLM-Optimized Documentation

Moose now publishes lightweight documentation bundles so AI assistants can reason about your project without scraping the entire site. Each docs page includes **LLM View** links for TypeScript and Python, and the CLI exposes HTTP endpoints that deliver pre-compiled reference text.

## Quick links

- TypeScript bundle: `/llm-ts.txt`
- Python bundle: `/llm-py.txt`
- Scoped bundle: append `?path=relative/docs/section` to either endpoint to fetch a specific subsection

You can open these URLs in a browser, pipe them into tooling, or share them with agents such as Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf. 

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Fetch the TypeScript bundle for the OLAP docs from the hosted site
curl "https://docs.fiveonefour.com/llm-ts.txt?path=moose/olap/model-table"
```

For project-specific knowledge, combine these static bundles with live context from the [MCP server](/moose/mcp-dev-server).
