# API Authentication & Security

Moose supports two authentication mechanisms for securing your API endpoints:

- **[API Keys](#api-key-authentication)** - Simple, static authentication for internal applications and getting started
- **[JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](#jwt-authentication)** - Token-based authentication for integration with existing identity providers

Choose the method that fits your use case, or use both together with custom configuration.

## Do you want to use API Keys?

API keys are the simplest way to secure your Moose endpoints. They're ideal for:
- Internal applications and microservices
- Getting started quickly with authentication
- Scenarios where you control both client and server

### How API Keys Work

API keys use PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hashing for secure storage. You generate a token pair (plain-text and hashed) using the Moose CLI, store the hashed version in environment variables, and send the plain-text version in your request headers.

### Step 1: Generate API Keys

Generate tokens and hashed keys using the Moose CLI:

```bash
moose generate hash-token
```

**Output:**
- **ENV API Keys**: Hashed key for environment variables (use this in your server configuration)
- **Bearer Token**: Plain-text token for client applications (use this in `Authorization` headers)

<Callout type="info">
  Use the **hashed key** for environment variables and `moose.config.toml`. Use the **plain-text token** in your `Authorization: Bearer token` headers.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Configure API Keys with Environment Variables

Set environment variables with the **hashed** API keys you generated:
```bash
# For ingest endpoints
export MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'

# For analytics endpoints  
export MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'

# For admin endpoints
export MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN='your_plain_text_token'
```

Or set the admin API key in `moose.config.toml`:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[authentication]
admin_api_key = "your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key"
```

<Callout type="info" title="Storing Admin API Keys in Project Configuration File">
  Storing the `admin_api_key` (which is a PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hash) in your `moose.config.toml` file is an acceptable practice, even if the file is version-controlled. This is because the actual plain-text Bearer token (the secret) is not stored. The hash is computationally expensive to reverse, ensuring that your secret is not exposed in the codebase.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Make Authenticated Requests

All authenticated requests require the `Authorization` header with the **plain-text token**:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_plain_text_token_here" \
     https://your-moose-instance.com/ingest/YourDataModel

# Using JavaScript
fetch('https://your-moose-instance.com/api/endpoint', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_plain_text_token_here'
  }
})
```

## Do you want to use JWTs?

JWT authentication integrates with existing identity providers and follows standard token-based authentication patterns. Use JWTs when:
- You have an existing identity provider (Auth0, Okta, etc.)
- You need user-specific authentication and authorization
- You want standard OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect flows

### How JWT Works

Moose validates JWT tokens using RS256 algorithm with your identity provider's public key. You configure the expected issuer and audience, and Moose handles token verification automatically.

### Step 1: Configure JWT Settings

#### Option A: Configure in `moose.config.toml`

```toml filename=moose.config.toml
[jwt]
# Your JWT public key (PEM-formatted RSA public key)
secret = """
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAy...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
"""
# Expected JWT issuer
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
# Expected JWT audience  
audience = "my-moose-app"
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `secret` field should contain your JWT **public key** used to verify signatures using RS256 algorithm.
</Callout>

#### Option B: Configure with Environment Variables

You can also set these values as environment variables:

```bash filename=".env" copy
MOOSE_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_jwt_public_key # PEM-formatted RSA public key (overrides `secret` in `moose.config.toml`)
MOOSE_JWT_ISSUER=your_jwt_issuer # Expected JWT issuer (overrides `issuer` in `moose.config.toml`)
MOOSE_JWT_AUDIENCE=your_jwt_audience # Expected JWT audience (overrides `audience` in `moose.config.toml`)
```

### Step 2: Make Authenticated Requests

Send requests with the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here" \
     https://your-moose-instance.com/ingest/YourDataModel

# Using JavaScript
fetch('https://your-moose-instance.com/api/endpoint', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_jwt_token_here'
  }
})
```

## Want to use both? Here's the caveats

You can configure both JWT and API Key authentication simultaneously. When both are configured, Moose's authentication behavior depends on the `enforce_on_all_*` flags.

### Understanding Authentication Priority

#### Default Behavior (No Enforcement)

By default, when both JWT and API Keys are configured, Moose tries JWT validation first, then falls back to API Key validation:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
# JWT configuration
secret = "..."
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
audience = "my-moose-app"
# enforce flags default to false
```

```bash filename=".env"
# API Key configuration
MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'
MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'
```

**For Ingest Endpoints (`/ingest/*`)**:
- Attempts JWT validation first (RS256 signature check)
- Falls back to API Key validation (PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256) if JWT fails

**For Analytics Endpoints (`/api/*`)**:
- Same fallback behavior as ingest endpoints

This allows you to use either authentication method for your clients.

#### Enforcing JWT Only

If you want to **only** accept JWT tokens (no API key fallback), set the enforcement flags:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
secret = "..."
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
audience = "my-moose-app"
# Only accept JWT, no API key fallback
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = true
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = true
```

**Result**: When enforcement is enabled, API Key authentication is disabled even if the environment variables are set. Only valid JWT tokens will be accepted.

### Common Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Different Auth for Different Endpoints

Configure JWT for user-facing analytics endpoints, API keys for internal ingestion:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
secret = "..."
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
audience = "my-moose-app"
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = true  # JWT only for /api/*
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false        # Allow fallback for /ingest/*
```

```bash filename=".env"
MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY='hashed_key_for_internal_services'
```

#### Use Case 2: Migration from API Keys to JWT

Start with both configured, no enforcement. Gradually migrate clients to JWT. Once complete, enable enforcement:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
secret = "..."
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
audience = "my-moose-app"
# Start with both allowed during migration
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = false
# Later, enable to complete migration
# enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = true
# enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = true
```

### Admin Endpoints

Admin endpoints use API key authentication exclusively (configured separately from ingest/analytics endpoints).

**Configuration precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. `--token` CLI parameter (plain-text token)
2. `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable (plain-text token)
3. `admin_api_key` in `moose.config.toml` (hashed token)

**Example:**

```bash
# Option 1: CLI parameter
moose remote plan --token your_plain_text_token

# Option 2: Environment variable
export MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN='your_plain_text_token'
moose remote plan

# Option 3: Config file
# In moose.config.toml:
# [authentication]
# admin_api_key = "your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key"
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit plain-text tokens to version control** - Always use hashed keys in configuration files
- **Use environment variables for production** - Keep secrets out of your codebase
- **Generate unique tokens for different environments** - Separate development, staging, and production credentials
- **Rotate tokens regularly** - Especially for long-running production deployments
- **Choose the right method for your use case**:
  - Use **API Keys** for internal services and getting started
  - Use **JWT** when integrating with identity providers or need user-level auth
- **Store hashed keys safely** - The PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hash in `moose.config.toml` is safe to version control, but the plain-text token should only exist in secure environment variables or secret management systems

  Never commit plain-text tokens to version control. Use hashed keys in configuration files and environment variables for production.
